### Simulation Management:

The simulation process in EnergyPlus involves a series of flags to manage the flow and determine the simulation state. The simulation manager controls the entire process, ensuring accurate initialization and operation through various environmental and temporal conditions.

### Warmup and Convergence:

At the start of each environment, initial conditions are set, and warmup periods are used to ensure stability. Proper convergence is crucial for accurate load and HVAC calculations, especially in shorter simulations used for system sizing. 

Overall, EnergyPlus is designed to handle complex interactions within building systems, providing detailed insights into energy performance and efficiency.The given text discusses the impact of economic and energy factors on buildings using EnergyPlus, a simulation tool used in building design. It delves into the processes and methodologies employed by EnergyPlus for warmup convergence and integrated simulations. 

EnergyPlus tracks four parameters during warmup convergence: the maximum and minimum zone air temperatures, maximum heating load, and maximum cooling load for each zone. These parameters are compared against convergence tolerance values over consecutive days to ensure simulations have reached steady-periodic conditions. The text explains the importance of avoiding false negative indications for percentage load differences, especially when zonal loads are small, by setting a minimum load threshold.

The integrated simulation approach of EnergyPlus contrasts with sequential simulations like those in BLAST or DOE-2, where building zones, air handling systems, and central plant equipment are simulated without feedback. In EnergyPlus, the simultaneous solution scheme is employed, integrating all elements controlled by the Integrated Solution Manager using successive substitution iteration and the Gauss-Seidel philosophy.

The basis for zone and air system integration in EnergyPlus involves formulating energy and moisture balances for zone air, solved using a predictor-corrector approach. Various solution algorithms, such as the 3rdOrderBackwardDifference, EulerMethod, and AnalyticalSolution, are provided to solve the zone air energy and moisture balance equations. The text describes the use of finite difference approximations and numerical integration to estimate zone air temperatures and manage potential truncation errors in long simulations.

The document elaborates on the predictor-corrector scheme, detailing the process for calculating air system energy demands, simulating air supply capabilities, and adjusting zone temperatures accordingly. It also discusses the air system control logic, highlighting the challenges of simulating real-world controllers in a numerical model due to discrete time steps and potential instability in feedback loops between zone and air systems.

Finally, the text covers the predictive system energy balance method, which estimates air system output needed to maintain desired zone temperatures, allowing for zone temperature adjustments based on actual air system response. This method, akin to a predictor-corrector approach, ensures that the simulation reflects realistic air system controls and zone temperature regulation.The process of managing excess exhaust and return air flow in an air loop system involves several steps. First, the excess exhaust for all zones on a given air loop is totaled. If a zone with excess exhaust is served by more than one air loop, the exhaust is shared by each air loop in proportion to the maximum available outdoor air for a given air loop. The formula for calculating the total excess exhaust flow for an air loop is:

\[ \dot{m}_{ExcessExh,i} = \sum_j \dot{m}_{ExcessExh,j} \cdot \frac{\dot{m}_{MaxOA,i}}{\dot{m}_{TotOA,j}} \]

The adjusted total return flow for each air loop is calculated by subtracting the excess exhaust from the total return flow calculated earlier:

\[ \dot{m}_{AdjReturn,i} = \max(0.0, \dot{m}_{OrigReturn,i} - \dot{m}_{ExcessExh,i}) \]

Finally, the return flow for each return node on the air loop is proportioned to the adjusted total return flow:

\[ \dot{m}_{R,i} = \dot{m}_{R,i} \cdot \frac{\dot{m}_{AdjReturn,i}}{\dot{m}_{OrigReturn,i}} \]

Key variables involved in these calculations include:

- \( \dot{m}_{R} \): total zone return air mass flow rate (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{S} \): total zone supply air mass flow rate (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{EX,tot} \): total zone exhaust air mass flow rate from all zone exhaust air nodes (kg/s)

Zone mixing flow rates are calculated based on user-specified values and the zone air mass flow balance requirements. An individual zone may be a source zone for multiple receiving zones, and the same source zone may receive mixing flows from multiple adjacent zones in an air loop. The source and receiving mass flow rates of ZoneMixing objects are calculated from user-defined mixing flow rates at the first HVAC iteration for each time step and adjusted in subsequent iterations to balance the zone air mass flow.

Zone air mass flow balance can be enforced using four options: AdjustMixingOnly, AdjustReturnOnly, AdjustMixingThenReturn, or AdjustReturnThenMixing. These options involve either adjusting zone mixing objects flows, adjusting the zone total return air flows, or a combination of both.

Infiltration flow rate adjustments can be handled with options like None, AddInfiltrationFlow, and AdjustInfiltrationFlow. If a zone is included in the infiltration adjustment, the infiltration air mass flow rate required to balance the zone is determined as follows:

\[ \dot{m}_{Inf-required} = \max(0.0, \dot{m}_{XS} + \dot{m}_{EX} + \dot{m}_{R} - \dot{m}_{S} - \dot{m}_{XR,new}) \]

EnergyPlus models building performance over time using a time marching method based on timesteps. This approach involves recalculating model equations at each timestep, using a quasi-steady energy balance approach, to predict conditions present during each timestep.

The need for a variable timestep in EnergyPlus was identified to ensure stability, allowing the simulation to adapt when zone conditions change rapidly. System and plant loop simulations are solved simultaneously, ensuring that water loop conditions align with maximum plant capacity.The text describes the formulation and application of conduction transfer functions (CTFs) in building thermal analysis, particularly within the EnergyPlus software. CTFs provide a method to predict heat flux across building elements, relating it to temperature histories on both sides of a material. This is achieved through linear equations with constant coefficients, making the calculation of heat transfer both efficient and straightforward as it relies on predetermined coefficients specific to each construction type. The state space method is a preferred approach for calculating these CTFs due to its accuracy and stability, even with complex, multi-layered materials. This method uses matrix algebra to derive heat fluxes from environmental temperatures, without needing to solve for internal temperatures. The text also discusses challenges and solutions related to short time step calculations, which can lead to instability in CTFs due to round-off errors. Various methods, such as multiple, staggered time history schemes, are proposed to mitigate these issues. The text further explains the special handling of "R-Value only" layers, which lack thermal mass, by treating them as single node layers. This approach avoids assigning fictitious properties to these materials, enhancing the accuracy of simulations.Certainly! Here's the structured and meaningful text derived from the provided unstructured text, with directories, references, and meaningless sentences removed:

EnergyPlus handles scenarios with "no mass" layers in construction by converting such layers into thermal mass layers using air properties. This ensures calculations remain realistic without resorting to problematic scenarios. A "no mass" layer defined anywhere but the inner or outer layer is treated as a single node layer, adding resistance between nodes without thermal capacitance. The A matrix (AMat) is assigned values at the interface using specific equations, ensuring that "no mass" layers are properly handled without air properties.

For finite difference solutions, EnergyPlus employs a Conduction Finite Difference (CondFD) algorithm, complementing the Conduction Transfer Function (CTF) solution. This is particularly useful for simulating phase change materials or variable thermal conductivity. Two schemes are available: Crank-Nicholson and fully implicit, selected via the HeatBalanceSettings:ConductionFiniteDifference input object. Both schemes utilize supporting models for material properties and spatial discretization.

The Crank-Nicholson scheme is semi-implicit, employing an Adams-Moulton approach, while the fully implicit scheme follows a similar methodology but is first-order in time. Both schemes involve specific equations for node temperatures and are accompanied by an enthalpy-temperature function. For phase change materials, specific heat is calculated dynamically based on temperature changes.

The Conduction Finite Difference model determines node arrangement based on thermal diffusivity and selected time steps, with space discretization controlled by the user. This model assigns different node spacing to various material layers, reflecting their distinct thermal properties. Iterations ensure convergence, with controls for relaxation factors to maintain stability.

For phase change materials, specific heat is calculated from temperature/enthalpy pairs. The hysteresis model accounts for the dynamic nature of these materials, with inputs for thermal conductivity and density. The algorithm is equipped to handle variable thermal conductivity and source/sink layers.

Heat flux outputs at each node and heat capacitance of each half-node are calculated, providing detailed thermal performance data for constructions. This ensures that EnergyPlus simulations capture the intricacies of heat and moisture transfer accurately.

This structured overview highlights the main components and methodologies discussed in the original text, focusing on the application within the EnergyPlus software for heat balance calculations in buildings.The text discusses the management of surface heat balance in a zone, focusing on large surfaces, thermal mass, and radiative heat exchange. 

When one surface in a zone is significantly larger than the others, reciprocity in heat exchange is enforced, but ensuring completeness without self-viewing becomes challenging. In these cases, the large surface is allowed to see itself. This adjustment is necessary for zones with large surfaces like Trombe Walls or single-story areas. Thermal mass surfaces, participating in long-wave radiation exchange, require view factor calculations. In such scenarios, dividing the large surface into smaller ones is recommended to maintain a normal enclosure.

The Carroll method simplifies gray-body long-wave radiation exchange by using a mean radiant temperature node, reducing complexity from O(n²) to linear. It involves calculating mean radiant temperature view factors, gray-body radiation resistance, and finally the mean radiant temperature to determine net long-wave radiation exchange.

Furniture in a zone increases surface area and thermal mass, affecting temperature response and heat extraction. Internal long-wave radiation models define a radiative/convective split for equipment heat but lack detail due to complexity.

Short-wave radiation from lights and solar transmission is distributed over surfaces according to prescribed methods, maintaining uniform conditions.

Convection flux, part of the heat balance, is calculated using heat transfer coefficients, which can be modeled in various ways. EnergyPlus offers options for inside convection coefficients, allowing user customization and adaptation to different conditions. The adaptive convection algorithm by Beausoleil-Morrison dynamically selects suitable convection equations based on surface characteristics and flow regimes, with modifications for realistic modeling in EnergyPlus.

Overall, inside surface heat balance management in EnergyPlus involves complex interactions between surface characteristics, radiation, convection, and conduction processes, with a focus on accurate and adaptable modeling to reflect real-world conditions.The text discusses various heat transfer correlations developed by researchers for different types of surfaces in building environments. These correlations are used to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients, which are crucial for understanding heat flow in building zones. The document references several studies:

1. **Fisher and Pedersen (1997)**: Developed equations for ceiling diffusers based on laboratory measurements. For example, the heat transfer coefficient for floors is given by \( h = 3.873 + 0.082 \times ACH^{0.98} \).

2. **Alamdari and Hammond (1983)**: Created correlations for stable and unstable horizontal surfaces, vertical walls, and different thermal situations. For instance, the horizontal stable correlation is \( h = 0.6 \times |\Delta T| \times D_h^{1/5} \).

3. **Khalifa (1989)**: Conducted experiments to formulate correlations for walls and ceilings in convectively heated zones. Equations like \( h = 2.07 \times |\Delta T|^{0.23} \) for walls away from heat sources are examples.

4. **Awbi and Hatton (1999)**: Focused on actively heated floor surfaces, providing equations like \( h = 2.175 \times |\Delta T|^{0.308} \times D_h^{0.076} \).

5. **Beausoleil-Morrison (2000)**: Used blending techniques to create correlations for mixed thermal situations, combining mechanical and buoyancy forces.

6. **Fohanno and Polidori (2006)**: Provided correlations for vertical walls under buoyancy flow conditions.

7. **Karadag (2009)**: Developed equations for chilled ceiling surfaces.

8. **ISO 15099**: Offers equations for heat transfer on windows and surfaces with various tilt angles.

9. **Goldstein and Novoselac (2010)**: Developed correlations for perimeter zones with highly glazed spaces using overhead slot-diffuser systems.

10. **Walton (1983)**: Introduced the TARP algorithm for natural convection, based on ASHRAE data, considering surface orientation and temperature differences.

11. **ASTM C1340 Algorithm**: Specifies simulations for attic zones, considering factors like surface-to-air temperature difference and air speed.

These correlations and algorithms are integral to the EnergyPlus heat balance processes, allowing for precise modeling of thermal behavior in different zones and surfaces of buildings.Here's the structured text derived from the provided unstructured content:

---

### Heat Balance Calculation in EnergyPlus

The heat balance on the inside face can be expressed as follows:

\[ q''_{LWX} + q''_{SW} + q''_{LWS} + q''_{ki} + q''_{sol} + q''_{conv} + q''_{add} = 0 \]

where \( q''_{add} \) represents pre-calculated results of the heat flux to the inside face from other heat transfer processes.

### Adiabatic Boundary Conditions

EnergyPlus applies adiabatic boundary conditions to:
1. Surfaces with adiabatic outside boundary conditions.
2. Internal Mass objects.

For both surface types, EnergyPlus applies the same boundary conditions to each side of the construction, ensuring no temperature difference across the surface. All heat transfer into the surface results from the dynamic response of the construction to varying inside boundary conditions. The surface will store and release heat only at the inside face.

### Infrared Radiation Transfer Material

EnergyPlus includes infrared (IR) radiation exchange among all surfaces within the zone. A zone is characterized by a single uniform air temperature due to the well-stirred air model. However, in certain configurations, such as large atria or underfloor air distribution systems, the air temperature may vary spatially within the zone. The IRT model allows for subzones, each having the well-stirred air model, to exchange IR radiation with surfaces throughout the original space.

### Transparent Insulation Material (TIM)

TIMs are designed for solar collector systems to increase insulation without reducing solar energy transmittance. TIMs transmit shortwave radiation and act as barriers to longwave radiation, thus allowing solar energy to penetrate deeper into the building structure. This results in increased internal temperature and potential heating during sunny conditions. 

### Types of Transparent Insulation Materials

TIMs are classified into four categories:
1. Absorber Parallel Covers
2. Cavity Structures
3. Absorber Vertical Covers
4. Quasi-Homogeneous Structures

These classifications impact how solar rays are transmitted through the transparent insulation layer.

### Basic Mathematical Model

The mathematical model calculates the energy absorbed at the surface of movable insulation (TIM) and at the outside surface of the wall:

\[ Q_{SM} = \alpha_{TIM} \cdot \text{IncidentSolar} \]

The total solar gain on any exterior surface combines the absorption of direct and diffuse solar radiation:

\[ \text{IncidentSolar} = (I_b \cdot \cos \theta \cdot S_s + I_s \cdot F_{ss} + I_g \cdot F_{sg}) \]

\[ \alpha_{\text{wall}} + \rho_{\text{wall}} = 1 \]

\[ Q_{SO} = (\tau_{TIM} \cdot Q_{SM}) \cdot \left(\frac{\alpha_{\text{wall}}}{\alpha_{TIM}} + (1 - \alpha_{\text{wall}})\right) \]

Where:
- \( Q_{SM} \) is the shortwave radiant flux absorbed at the surface of Movable Insulation.
- \( Q_{SO} \) is the shortwave radiant flux absorbed at the surface of the Wall.
- \( \alpha_{TIM} \) and \( \tau_{TIM} \) are the absorptance and transmittance of TIM, respectively.
- \( \alpha_{\text{wall}} \) and \( \rho_{\text{wall}} \) are the absorptance and reflectance of the wall surface.

Below is a structured text extracted from the provided unstructured content, focusing on the meaningful and relevant information regarding ground heat transfer and simulation methodologies:

---

**Concrete Layer Properties**

- **Thickness**: 0.15 m
- **Conductivity**: 1.95 W/m·K
- **Density**: 2240 kg/m³
- **Specific Heat**: 900 J/kg·K

The resistance of the concrete layer is calculated as Rcon = 0.15/1.95 = 0.077 m²·K/W.

**Ground Heat Transfer Calculations**

To simulate heat transfer with horizontal building surfaces in contact with the ground, a finite difference ground model is used. This model is suitable for slab-in-grade or slab-on-grade scenarios and interacts with the zone through an OthersideConditionsModel as the outside boundary condition.

**Approach and Methodology**

The model employs an implicit finite difference formulation to solve for ground temperatures and is stable across all timesteps and grid sizes. It iterates to converge temperatures for each timestep, accommodating multiple horizontal surfaces linked to each ground domain object. The domain updates the OtherSideConditionsModel temperatures for surface heat balance calculations.

**Boundary Conditions**

At the interface surface, the average conduction heat flux from all surfaces connected to the ground domain is applied as a boundary condition. The formulation considers far-field temperatures as boundary temperatures, using ground temperature profiles from Kusuda & Achenbach 1965, which requires annual ground surface temperature data. Surface heat balance considers radiation, conduction, and convection, along with evapotranspiration rates.

**Simulation Methodology**

The ground domain updates at each zone timestep or hourly, as specified. It applies surface heat flux boundary conditions from the previous timestep and calculates new OthersideConditionsModel temperatures. For hourly updates, it aggregates surface heat flux for the domain to update outside surface temperatures.

**Insulation Configurations for GroundDomain Model**

- **In-Grade**: Variations include combinations of vertical and horizontal insulation.
- **On-Grade**: Horizontal insulation is mandatory in some configurations.

**Basement Heat Transfer Calculations**

The model extends to simulate basements by adjusting for surfaces below ground. It uses similar methodologies to handle basement surface and insulation configurations, allowing multiple basement zones to couple with each domain object.

**Boundary Conditions and Methodology**

At zone interface surfaces, average conduction heat flux is imposed as a boundary condition. The methodology involves standard surface heat balance models with horizontal and vertical insulation simulated by the ground domain finite difference solver.

**Undisturbed Ground Temperature Models**

This structured representation consolidates key points about the simulation models, methodologies, and configurations used in ground heat transfer calculations.Here's a structured version of the provided text, with unnecessary elements removed:

---

**Exterior Naturally Vented Cavity**

The temperature of the baffle, \( Ts,baff \), is determined by the following equation:

\[ Ts,baff = \frac{(Is\alpha + h_{co}T_{amb} + hr,atmT_{amb} + hr,skyT_{sky} + hr,gndT_{amb} + hr,cavT_{so} + hc,cavT_{a,cav} + q''_{source})}{(h_{co} + hr,air + hr,sky + hr,gnd + hr,cav + hc,cav)} \]

Where:
- \( Is \) is the incident solar radiation [W/m²].
- \( \alpha \) is the solar absorptivity of the baffle.
- \( hr,atm \) is the linearized radiation coefficient for the surrounding atmosphere [W/m²·K].
- \( T_{amb} \) is the outdoor dry-bulb temperature [°C].
- \( hr,sky \) is the linearized radiation coefficient for the sky [W/m²·K].
- \( T_{sky} \) is the effective sky temperature [°C].
- \( hr,gnd \) is the linearized radiation coefficient for the ground [W/m²·K].
- \( hr,cav \) is the linearized radiation coefficient for the underlying surface [W/m²·K].
- \( T_{so} \) is the temperature of the outside face of the underlying heat transfer surface [°C].
- \( h_{co} \) is the convection coefficient for the outdoor environment [W/m²·K].
- \( hc,cav \) is the convection coefficient for the surfaces facing the plenum [W/m²·K].
- \( T_{a,cav} \) is the dry-bulb temperature for air in the cavity [°C].

**Cavity Heat Balance**

The cavity is the volume of air located between the baffle and the underlying heat transfer surface. The cavity air is modeled as well-mixed, and the uniform temperature of the cavity air, \( T_{a,cav} \), is determined by a heat balance:

\[ \dot{Q}_{vent} + \dot{Q}_{co} + \dot{Q}_{c,baff} = 0 \]

Where:
- \( \dot{Q}_{vent} \) is the net rate of energy added from natural ventilation.
- \( \dot{Q}_{co} \) is the net rate of energy added by surface convection heat transfer with the underlying surface.
- \( \dot{Q}_{c,baff} \) is the net rate of energy added by surface convection heat transfer with the collector.

Substituting into the equation, we get:

\[ T_{a,cav} = \frac{(hc,cavAT_{so} + \dot{m}_{vent}c_pT_{amb} + hc,cavAT_{s,baff})}{(hc,cavA + \dot{m}_{vent}c_p + hc,cavA)} \]

Where:
- \( \dot{m}_{vent} \) is the air mass flow from natural forces [kg/s].

**Modeling Natural Ventilation**

Natural ventilation air exchanges are modeled using correlations for natural ventilation. The air mass flow rate, \( \dot{m}_{vent} \), is a function of wind and buoyancy forces:

\[ \dot{m}_{vent} = \rho \dot{V}_{tot} \]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the density of air [kg/m³].
- \( \dot{V}_{tot} = \dot{V}_{wind} + \dot{V}_{thermal} \) is the total volumetric flow rate of air ventilating in and out of the cavity.
- \( \dot{V}_{wind} = C_vA_{in}U_{\infty} \)
- \( \dot{V}_{thermal} = C_DA_{in}\sqrt{2g\Delta H_{NPL}(T_{a,cav} - T_{amb})/T_{a,cav}} \) (if \( T_{a,cav} > T_{amb} \))

With coefficients \( C_v \) and \( C_D \), and gravitational constant \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

**Underlying Heat Transfer Surface**

The exterior baffle and cavity system is modeled using EnergyPlus methods for handling heat capacity and transients.

**Solar and Shading Calculations**

The model uses EnergyPlus surfaces for detailed solar and shading calculations, accounting for beam and diffuse radiation, and shading from nearby surfaces.

**Local Wind Speed Calculations**

Local wind speed is adjusted from meteorological data using terrain-dependent coefficients, applying corrections for different terrain and building heights.

**Convection Coefficients**

Surface convection heat transfer coefficients are calculated using standard methods, depending on Rayleigh number and surface tilt.

**Radiation Coefficients**

Linearized radiation coefficients are used for thermal radiation modeling, simplifying the heat balance equations while maintaining accuracy.

**Green Roof Model (EcoRoof)**

The green roof model accounts for radiative exchange, convective heat transfer, evapotranspiration, and heat conduction in the soil layer. The model enables users to specify green roof characteristics and simulate energy savings.

The energy budget analysis includes equations for soil surface and foliage temperatures, simplifying the complex interactions in the system.

This structured text retains the meaningful content while removing unnecessary references and directory mentions.The text discusses various models and calculations related to solar radiation and its interaction with the Earth's surface. It includes explanations of models such as the ASHRAE Revised Clear Sky Model, the Zhang-Huang Solar Model, and the Perez Direct/Diffuse Splitting Model. These models are used to estimate solar irradiance under different atmospheric conditions.

The ASHRAE Revised Clear Sky Model, also known as the "Tau Model," introduces location-specific optical depths for direct and diffuse radiation, which are tabulated for various locations. This model requires the calculation of relative air mass and applies empirical relationships to determine irradiance values, taking into account local conditions such as elevation and atmospheric components.

The Zhang-Huang Solar Model, initially developed for China, uses variables like cloud cover, temperature, and humidity to estimate total solar radiation. This model is particularly useful for meteorological studies and weather file generation.

The Perez Direct/Diffuse Splitting Model splits global solar radiation into direct and diffuse components. This is crucial for energy modeling applications, as it allows for more accurate simulations of solar energy availability.

Additionally, the text touches on the shadowing of solar radiation, which involves calculating how much of a building's surface is sunlit or shaded at any given time. This is important for understanding heat gains and losses in buildings due to solar exposure.

This structured version maintains the original content's essence and ensures clarity by organizing the information into clear sections.Daylight Factor Calculation: Daylight factors, which are ratios of interior illuminance to exterior horizontal illuminance, are pre-calculated and stored for later use. The user specifies the coordinates of one or more reference points in each daylit zone. DElight calculates the contribution of light transmitted through all fenestration systems in the zone to the illuminance at each reference point and to the luminance at subdivided nodal patches of interior surfaces for a given exterior luminous environment. Inter-reflection between interior reflecting surfaces is calculated, resulting in a final total illuminance at each reference point. This total illuminance is divided by the exterior horizontal illuminance to give a daylight factor. Daylight factors are calculated for each reference point for a set of sun positions and sky conditions representative of the building location.

Time-Step Interior Daylighting Calculation: A daylighting calculation is performed for each heat-balance time step when the sun is up. Illuminance at the reference points in each zone is found by interpolating the stored daylight factors using the current time step sun position and sky condition, then multiplying by the exterior horizontal illuminance.

Electric Lighting Control Calculation: The electric lighting control system is simulated to determine the proportion of lighting energy needed to make up the difference between the daylighting illuminance level at the given time step and the design illuminance level. The zone lighting electric reduction factor is passed to the thermal calculation, which uses this factor to reduce the heat gain from lights.

DElight Daylight Factor Calculation Differences from SplitFlux Methods: DElight calculates the total initial contribution of light transmitted through all fenestration systems in the zone to the illuminance at each reference point. This differs from the models behind the “Daylighting:Controls” object using the SplitFlux Daylighting Method. SplitFlux calculates initial illuminance values at reference points for each pair of reference point and aperture, whereas DElight calculates the total contribution from all apertures to each reference point. DElight does not account for interior surface obstructions in this initial interior illuminance/luminance distribution. DElight allows up to 100 reference points to be arbitrarily positioned within a daylighting zone.

Complex Fenestration System Calculation: DElight calculates the contribution to the initial interior illuminance at each reference point and to the luminance at each gridded nodal patch of interior surfaces of the light transmitted by complex fenestration systems (CFS). The analysis is based on bi-directional transmittance distribution functions (BTDF), which must be either pre-calculated or pre-measured, prior to analysis by DElight. The pre-calculated or pre-measured BTDF for a CFS is independent of its final position and orientation within a building.

Inter-reflected Interior Illuminance/Luminance Calculation: The effect of inter-reflection of the initial interior illuminance/luminance between interior reflecting surfaces is calculated using a radiosity method. This method subdivides each reflecting surface in the zone into nodal patches and uses view factors between all nodal patch pairs in an iterative calculation of the total contribution of reflected light within the zone. The ability to input up to 100 reference points supports a more complete assessment of this distribution. The radiosity method explicitly accounts for interior obstructions between pairs of nodal patches.

DElight Time-Step Interior Daylighting Calculation Differences from SplitFlux Methods: DElight does not support dynamic control of fenestration shading during the subsequent time-step calculations, as does the SplitFlux method. DElight does not currently calculate a measure of visual quality such as glare due to daylighting. Electric Lighting Control Calculation: Up to 100 reference points can be defined within a DElight daylighting zone. Each reference point input includes the fraction of the zone controlled by that point.

Complex Fenestration Daylighting Calculations: The complex fenestration systems (CFS) daylighting calculation method results in Daylighting Factor style output. Transmitted solar radiation reaches the daylighting sensor in two different ways: an indirect path when solar radiation is reflected from surfaces and uniformly distributed into the space, and a direct path when the sensor is directly illuminated by the fenestration system. For the indirect path, the method performs a one-bounce calculation to determine the diffuse illumination for the zone. For the direct path, the window is subdivided, and illuminance is calculated based on BSDF data for the outgoing direction.

Internal Average Reflected Illuminance From Window: To calculate internal average reflected illuminance from the window, it is necessary to calculate transmitted flux at the window. Illuminance can originate from the sky or sun, and the calculation is divided into parts for sky-related, sun-related illuminance, and luminous flux. Total illuminance is calculated as a superposition of these parts.

Luminance from Exterior Elements: The case of CFS luminance from exterior elements can be calculated using BSDF incoming directions defined for a given CFS. Luminous Flux and Direct Illuminance at Interior Side of the Window: For a given amount of illuminance at an incoming direction, flux into an outgoing direction is calculated. Handling Exterior Obstructions: Exterior obstructions are handled for two cases: between the luminous element and the CFS window element, and between the luminous elements and the ground element.

Daylighting Devices: Daylighting devices are used to improve daylighting in a zone. Tubular daylighting devices, also known as tubular skylights or light pipes, are constructed of three components: a dome, a pipe, and a diffuser. The dome allows daylight into the pipe, the pipe channels the daylight from the dome to the diffuser, and the diffuser evenly distributes the daylight to the zone. Solar gains and conductive/convective gains are simulated by the zone heat balance, while daylighting is simulated independently. The total transmittance of the TDD is fundamental to all phenomena covered by the model.The text discusses the properties and modeling of Tubular Daylighting Devices (TDDs), which are systems designed to transmit natural light into buildings. These systems are analyzed in terms of their reflectivity and transmittance properties, focusing on how light interacts with their components: the dome, the pipe, and the diffuser.

1. **Reflectivity and Transmittance**: TDDs have high reflectivity, generally ranging from 0.90 to 0.99. The transmittance of light through a TDD pipe is calculated numerically due to the complexity of the integral involved. A polynomial fit was considered for quick calculations, but interpolation of tabulated values was found to be more accurate.

2. **Beam Transmittance**: The beam transmittance of a TDD is calculated as the product of the transmittances of the dome, pipe, and diffuser. The model assumes constant transmittance irrespective of the incident angle. The effect of bends in the pipe, which can reduce transmittance, is not included in the basic model but can be manually adjusted by users.

3. **Daylighting and Solar Gains**: In daylighting simulations, the TDD replaces traditional window transmittance with TDD-specific transmittance. The illuminance due to direct and diffuse solar radiation is calculated for both daylighting and heat balance simulations. The solar gains are calculated separately for sun, sky, and ground radiation, with specific transmittances applied to each type.

4. **Diffuse Transmittance**: For diffuse radiation, the transmittance is calculated by integrating the beam transmittance over the hemisphere. This is essential for modeling sky radiation, which has an anisotropic distribution.

5. **Conductive and Convective Gains**: TDDs are treated as entities with effective thermal resistance, impacting heat gains from solar radiation absorbed in the pipe and glazing. The model incorporates internal reflections and absorptions to calculate heat distribution.

6. **Daylighting Shelves**: These are modeled to enhance daylighting by reflecting light onto ceilings. They consist of a window, an inside shelf, and an outside shelf. The simulation treats these shelves as surfaces affecting light distribution and heat balance within the zone.

The document provides a detailed mathematical foundation for these calculations, ensuring that TDDs are accurately modeled in simulations to optimize both lighting and thermal performance.The structured text, while maintaining the meaningful content, is as follows:

### Window Heat Balance and Incident Radiation

For reporting purposes, shelf radiation is included in the "Surface Outside Face Incident Ground Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate per Area" output variable. The incident radiation is determined, and the remaining window heat balance is calculated normally. The resulting transmitted diffuse radiation from the sky, ground, and shelf is calculated using the formula:

\[ q''_{\text{trans}} = q''_{\text{sky-inc}} + q''_{\text{gnd-inc}} + q''_{\text{shelf-inc}} \cdot \tau_{\text{diff,sol}} \]

where \(\tau_{\text{diff,sol}}\) represents the diffuse window transmittance in the solar spectrum.

### Window Light Well

The input object `DaylightingDevice:LightWell` provides a model for attenuation of light transmitted by windows and skylights due to surrounding interior finish surfaces forming a "light well." This model attenuates the light transmitted by the external window but does not redirect light distributions or alter the mixture of diffuse and beam transmitted by the window. The attenuation is characterized by the well efficiency, which is the ratio of the amount of light leaving the well to the amount of light entering the well. Well efficiency is utilized only in the EnergyPlus detailed daylighting calculation.

The well efficiency depends on the visible reflectance of the well’s side walls and the well cavity ratio (WCR), given by:

\[ \text{WCR} = \frac{2.5 \times \text{Well Height} \times \text{Well Perimeter}}{\text{Well Area}} \]

### Window Calculation Module

EnergyPlus provides two potential modeling approaches for windows. The primary approach is a layer-by-layer model where windows are comprised of glazing, gaps, frames, dividers, and shading devices. 

#### Optical Properties of Glazing

The solar radiation transmitted by a system of glass layers and the solar radiation absorbed in each layer depend on:

- Transmittance (\(T\))
- Front reflectance (\(R_f\))
- Back reflectance (\(R_b\))

These properties contribute to the zone heat balance and interior daylight illuminance from the glazing.

#### Simple Window Model

The simplified window model allows users to input simplified window performance indices using the `WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem` input object. This model converts these indices into an equivalent single-layer window, using U and SHGC indices, which are particularly useful when detailed data are unavailable.

The model calculates properties of an equivalent layer using several steps:

1. **Determine Glass-to-Glass Resistance:**
   - Incorporates interior and exterior surface heat transfer coefficients.

2. **Determine Layer Thickness:**
   - Calculated based on the glass-to-glass resistance.

3. **Determine Layer Thermal Conductivity:**
   - Effective thermal conductivity is derived from layer thickness and resistance.

4. **Determine Layer Solar Transmittance:**
   - Calculated using correlations as a function of SHGC and U-Factor.

6. **Determine Layer Visible Properties:**
   - Visible transmittance and reflectance properties are calculated.

7. **Determine Angular Performance:**
   - Angular properties are important for energy modeling due to varying solar incidence angles.

By adhering closely to these steps and utilizing available data effectively, the EnergyPlus model can simulate window performance efficiently and accurately, even with simplified input parameters.The text provides details on the properties and performance of various glazing systems and shading devices, focusing on their optical characteristics and how they are calculated.

   - The iterative process for adjusting U-factors in exterior windows is discussed, ensuring reported values align closely with inputs.

3. **Glazing System Properties**:
   - Optical properties of a glazing system with multiple layers are detailed, considering factors like transmittance, front and back reflectance, and absorption, all dependent on wavelength.
   - The equations provided account for internal reflections within the glazing system.

4. **Angular Properties**:
   - The document differentiates between uncoated and coated glass, describing how angular properties are calculated based on wavelength and incidence angles.
   - For uncoated glass, equations relate transmittance and reflectance to transmissivity and reflectivity, while for coated glass, regression fits are used for calculations.

5. **Hemispherical Values**:
   - The hemispherical value of a property is calculated through an integral evaluated by Simpson's rule, considering angles of incidence in 10-degree increments.

6. **Shading Devices**:
   - The impact of shading devices on system transmittance and absorptance is described, varying based on shade position and inter-reflection between the shading device and glazing.
   - Types of shading devices include shades, blinds, screens, and switchable glazing, each with specific characteristics affecting their optical properties.

7. **Switchable Glazing**:
   - Switchable glazing, like electrochromics, can alter their optical properties from light to dark states, controlled by a switching factor determined by the user.

8. **Thermochromic Windows**:
   - Thermochromic materials have optical properties that change with temperature, allowing for dynamic control over light and heat transmission.

This structured summary highlights the essential information about glazing systems and shading devices, focusing on their optical properties and performance calculations without altering the original content.The text provides a detailed explanation of the LBNL method for characterizing scattering fenestration systems, which has been incorporated into the WINDOW computer program. The method involves approximating integrals by finite sums using a set of finite solid angle elements that cover the relevant solid angle hemisphere. Each solid angle element is characterized by a direction, and this set is termed a basis.

The LBNL method uses several equations to describe the transmission and reflection properties of fenestration systems. These equations are expressed in matrix form, where the radiance in various directions is represented as the components of a vector. The method identifies infinitesimal directional irradiances with the components of an irradiance vector and uses these matrices to calculate the overall properties of a fenestration system.

For optical calculations, the method does not require knowledge of individual layers within the fenestration system. However, thermal calculations of heat flow through the fenestration require knowledge of the radiation absorbed by each layer, known as "in-situ layer absorptance." This absorptance accounts for the transmittance and interreflection by other layers before absorption.

The text also discusses the use of coordinate systems to describe radiation propagation in fenestration systems, highlighting the complexity of using multiple bases for incoming and outgoing radiation. The LBNL method simplifies matrix representations by using a particular choice of coordinate systems, aligning incoming and outgoing radiation at different surfaces.

In terms of practical application, the text explores how well the WINDOW calculation matches EnergyPlus requirements, considering the effect of the normal WINDOW basis in a typical office space. It emphasizes the importance of matching the basis to the calculation to avoid loss of angular detail or oversampling.

Finally, the text delves into the treatment of complex fenestrations in EnergyPlus, discussing exterior radiance models and the calculation of transmitted radiance for complex fenestration systems. It breaks down the outgoing radiance by source, including sky radiance, ground-reflected radiance, and sun radiance. The text provides detailed equations for calculating these components, considering the time-dependent nature of solar position and its impact on radiance calculations.The text provides a detailed explanation of the process for calculating glazing deflection and the thermal performance of multi-layer glazing systems. The deflection calculation involves an iterative method where the initial temperature distribution is determined for a non-deflected state, followed by deflection calculations based on this temperature distribution. New temperature distributions are computed for the deflected state, and the process repeats until the temperature difference between iterations is no larger than 0.1°C. The maximum deflection value for each pane, centered at the glazing, is calculated using a specific formula.

For glazing systems with more than two layers, deflection is evaluated for each pane, assuming that the pressure in the gaps is independent unless linked. Linked gaps have identical pressures, and the pressure is calculated from the temperatures of the bounding glazing. If gaps are linked to indoor or outdoor environments, their pressure is fixed.

The text also discusses the equivalent layer fenestration model, which handles optical and thermal properties of attachments like drapes and blinds. This model treats the fenestration as a series of layers separated by gaps, using effective properties to represent the layers. The model calculates effective solar optical properties and accounts for solar radiation interactions, including beam and diffuse components. The thermal model uses a surface energy balance to solve for temperatures and heat fluxes, providing U-factor and SHGC calculations.

The equivalent layer model offers flexibility in combining different glazing and shading layers and can simulate complex fenestration systems. It includes methods for calculating off-normal solar properties and uses empirical correlations for estimating material properties. This model supports various configurations of glazing and shading layers, enabling detailed analysis of fenestration performance.The text provides a detailed overview of the simulation process for HVAC systems, focusing on various components and processes within the system. Here's a structured and meaningful version:

---

**Air System Simulation Process**

1. **System Mass Balance and Resimulation:**
   - The `ResolveSysFlow` function checks and enforces the mass balance of the central air system. If the system lacks balance, a resimulation occurs, entailing a second pass in loop 2.

2. **Controller Simulation and Convergence:**
   - In loop 3, `ManageControllers` simulates controller actions and checks for convergence. If achieved, loop 3 exits. Steps 5 and 6 are repeated to ensure all components have final values.

3. **Update and Resimulation Flags:**
   - `UpdateHVACInterface` transfers primary air system outlet node data to zone equipment inlet nodes. If there's a data mismatch, the `SimZoneEquipment` flag triggers resimulation. An economizer activity flag is set to decide on resimulation needs.

**Outdoor Air System Simulation**

- **Purpose and Components:**
  - The `AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem` handles return air splitting into relief and recirculated air. It mixes recirculated and outside air using the `OutdoorAir:Mixer` and controls air flow rate (economizer control).

- **Simulation Process:**
  - Controllers, except `Controller:OutdoorAir`, are simulated at the primary air system level. Components in the outdoor air system are simulated in order from the `AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList`.

**Zone Equipment Simulation**

1. **Initialization and Input Data:**
   - If input data is missing, it's fetched and stored. Zone equipment initialization and design calculations are performed if needed.

2. **Simulation Sequence:**
   - `SimZoneEquipment` simulates demand-side components in air flow direction, including zone splitters and plenum simulations.

3. **Load Distribution and Iterations:**

- **Zone Mixer and Plenum:**
  - `ZoneMixer` combines multiple inlet streams into one outlet, using mass and energy balance equations. `ReturnPlenum` handles return air flow, incorporating duct leakage and secondary air connections.

**Plant Load Profile**

- **Functionality:**
  - The `LoadProfile:Plant` object simulates scheduled demand profiles, useful when building loads are known. It calculates outlet water temperature based on inlet temperature, scheduled load, and requested flow rate.

By structuring the text, it becomes easier to understand the different components and processes involved in the simulation of HVAC systems, from air system balancing to the detailed simulation of outdoor air systems and zone equipment.Certainly! Here is a structured summary of the provided text, focusing on meaningful content:

---

**SYSTEM MANAGER / PROCESSES**

- **Flow Rate Management**: The user-requested flow rate may not always match the plant loop's available flow rate. The actual flow rate used is the lesser of the two. The `LoadProfile:Plant` object can request and receive flow even if the scheduled plant load is zero, maintaining the same inlet and outlet temperatures, allowing for loop flow control without affecting temperature.

- **Energy Consumption Calculation**: Energy consumption is calculated using the equation \( E = Q_{\text{load}} \Delta t \), where \( E \) is energy consumption, \( Q_{\text{load}} \) is the scheduled plant load, and \( \Delta t \) is the time step interval.

**Plant/Condenser Loops**

- **Integration**: Air handling systems and central plant simulations are integrated. Plant outputs must match system inputs, with temperature and flow rate continuity. Coil controls ensure reasonable flow variable values.

- **Methodology**: HVAC simulations involve air loops (air as transport medium) and plant loops (liquid fluid, typically water). Plant loops are divided into supply and demand sides, with primary equipment like chillers on the supply side and load-placing equipment like coils on the demand side. Condenser loops have distinct control options.

- **Plant Half-Loops**: Plant loops are divided into "half-loops" for better simulation logistics. These sub-loops are connected to form a main plant loop, ensuring balanced results across simulations. Equipment on half-loops is organized in branches, with components in series and branches in parallel.

**Plant Manager**

- **Calling Order**: An initial calling order for half-loops is established, then revised during setup. The loop manager iteratively calls all half-loops, setting a fixed order for the simulation.

**Plant Flow Resolver**

- **Flow Rate Solution**: The flow resolver manages fluid flow rates within half-loops, adjusting supply to meet demand. Components register flow requests, which are categorized to determine overall loop flow needs.

- **Pump Control**: Pumps drive flow, with configurations for constant or variable speed, and continuous or intermittent operation. Pumps set the overall loop flow within their limits, striving to meet demand-side requests.

**Plant/Condenser Supply Side**

- **Component Simulation**: Components like boilers and chillers are simulated on the supply side, supporting parallel-serial configurations. A rules-based flow resolver enforces mass continuity and sets flow rates based on component needs.

- **Flow Control Types**: Components are classified into ACTIVE, SERIESACTIVE, PASSIVE, or BYPASS for flow control. ACTIVE components determine branch flow, while PASSIVE components operate with designated flow inputs.

--- 

This summary retains the essential details and concepts of the original text while providing a clear and structured overview.To enforce overall continuity on the loop, mass conservation allows all active branches to be satisfied first. The remaining flow is then divided between passive branches and, as a last resort, the bypass. If insufficient flow exists to meet branch demand, active branch requests are prioritized in the order they appear in the branch list. The flow rate is resolved individually for each branch, with priority given to active components.

Once the branches set their flow rates and constraints, the splitter and mixer resolve the various flow requests. Flow control happens at the splitter, which sums maximum and minimum constraints from all active branches and compares them to the inlet constraints. If there is a mismatch, the simulation defers to the inlet constraints, assuming the pump controls the loop flow. Adjustments between the splitter and mixer ensure mass balance, with excess flow directed first through the bypass branch, then passive branches, and finally back to active branches in reverse order.

In cases of a flow deficit, bypass and passive branches are set to zero, and active branch flow rates decrease in reverse order until the outlet matches available inlet flow. For plant loop deficits, the flow rates for active branches are calculated based on available mass flow.

The plant model includes simplified methods for fluid capacitance and temperature rise due to pumping and friction. The flow resolver concept maintains mass flow balance, while temperature control is achieved through iterative procedures. Pumping adds heat to the fluid, affecting primary equipment load, and is modeled in the loop capacitance.

The plant loop uses a loop capacitance model based on a well-stirred tank model. The loop volume is separated into tanks for each half-loop inlet, with capacitance affecting recovery speed from setpoint deviations. Temperature is modeled by drawing a control volume around the tank and recalculating at each timestep.

The plant flow resolver input consists of the plant BranchList and ConnectorList, linking the loop to branches and defining splitters and mixers. Five load distribution schemes are employed: Optimal, UniformLoad, SequentialLoad, UniformPLR, and SequentialUniformPLR. Each scheme distributes loop demand differently based on user-specified parameters and equipment characteristics.

Two plant loop demand calculation schemes exist: SingleSetPoint and DualSetPointDeadband. The SingleSetPoint scheme calculates heating or cooling load based on a single setpoint value, while the DualSetPointDeadband scheme uses high and low setpoints. These schemes determine the necessary heating or cooling to achieve loop setpoints, with the load distribution scheme allocating the load to the appropriate equipment.The Load Distribution scheme allocates the calculated load to the appropriate equipment. The Loop Demand Calculation Scheme, specifically the DualSetPointDeadband, calculates the heating or cooling load necessary to reach the setpoint values on the Node%TempSetPointHi and Node%TempSetPointLo. If the system is in the DeadBand, no load is calculated. The algorithm determines if heating or cooling is required based on the comparisons of LoadToHeatingSetPoint and LoadToCoolingSetPoint, leading to different loop demands.

The Plant and Condenser Equipment Operation Schemes control the operation of loops and equipment availability under varying conditions. The calculated loop load is allocated to supply equipment based on user input through operation schemes, which have a priority system. The first available scheme is used, and if unavailable, the priority list is checked until a suitable scheme is found.

Plant Operation Schemes include Uncontrolled Loop Operation, where equipment runs at full capacity, and Cooling/Heating Load Range Based Operation, which defines load ranges and equipment availability for each range. Load is allocated to equipment according to user-selected distribution schemes, promoting efficient operation.

Condenser Operation Schemes, similar to plant operations, apply to supply-side equipment like pumps and cooling towers. They use load range or environmental parameter-based schemes to determine equipment availability.

The Common Pipe feature in Primary-Secondary Loop Systems allows for a single setup in EnergyPlus, eliminating the need for separate loops. Pumps must be placed on both Demand and Supply sides, with the system simulating flow and temperature changes at interfaces.

The Two-Way Common Pipe model facilitates Primary-Secondary systems as a single Plant Loop, featuring additional flow paths and controlled nodes to achieve temperature setpoints. It calculates recirculation flows to meet desired setpoints even if not achievable with current conditions.

Heat Recovery Loop Systems use additional loops to recover heat from components like chillers and generators, with the recovered heat used elsewhere in the system, such as in a water heater. This setup allows for complex configurations and interactions.

Plant Pressure Drop Simulation, added in version 4.0, calculates loop pressure drops based on branch-level pressure drop information and dynamically updates pump power. It works for various configurations, ensuring realistic pressure values and accurate pump power calculations. Pressure drop is calculated at the branch level, with restrictions on component placement and pressure drop simulations in common pipe scenarios. The pressure system is initialized before demand simulation, and after branch simulation, pressure drop calculations occur at the loop level.The text discusses the simulation of pressure and steam systems in the EnergyPlus software. It begins with a pressure simulation approach that works backwards from the demand side, updating node pressure and summing loop pressure by adding pressure drops. When encountering parallel systems, the largest pressure drop governs the branches, achieved through "imaginary" valves in the splitter, ensuring uniform flow at the mixer.

Pressure drop calculations include generic curves for pressure as a function of mass flow rate and specific calculations for frictional and minor losses using known equations and coefficients. The pump simulation involves determining an operating point using a constant speed pump model, iterating with a quadratic pressure drop form. The text explains the importance of setting a pressure constant for each branch and calculating an equivalent value for parallel branches. 

The steam system in EnergyPlus uses the vapor phase of water for heating, offering advantages like moving unaided by external energy sources and being suitable for high-rise buildings. Steam systems can adjust temperature by varying steam pressure or temperature, making them ideal for various applications. The simulation assumes constant pressure in the steam loop and neglects frictional losses, focusing on latent and sensible heat addition processes. Steam traps are crucial, maintaining steam quality and ensuring condensate is returned to the boiler without superheating.

The text also touches on steam generation at saturated conditions, avoiding superheated steam due to its negligible energy benefits and potential damage. It concludes with the role of steam traps in controlling flow and maintaining system efficiency.The text discusses the process and modeling of steam systems and components, particularly focusing on steam traps, steam to air heat exchangers, and condensate pumps within the EnergyPlus simulation framework. 

Steam traps are crucial for managing the condensate produced by steam coils, ensuring only water exits the coil to prevent issues like water hammer and corrosion. They are modeled in EnergyPlus by setting the condensate outlet quality to 0.0, with subcooling factored in at lower pressures. Despite the valuable heat in condensate, retaining it within the coil can reduce heat transfer efficiency and operational performance, necessitating immediate removal via steam traps.

Loop losses in steam systems arise from unavoidable flash steam condensing and subcooling of condensate in return piping. These losses, represented in a Ts diagram, are calculated by the enthalpy difference between key points in the system. Such losses are inherent due to pressure drops and uninsulated return pipes, which can be mitigated by specialized heat recovery systems.

The steam to air heat exchanger model in EnergyPlus calculates the necessary steam mass flow rate to meet heating demands. This model incorporates latent heat transfer and sensible cooling, with assumptions of steam entering at saturation and leaving at a user-defined subcooling level. Control methods differ based on whether the coil is load-controlled or temperature-controlled, with pseudo-code provided to illustrate the simulation logic.

Condensate pumps are essential for returning condensed steam to the boiler, aiding in energy conservation and reducing corrosion. The pump model in EnergyPlus operates at variable speeds, adjusting to the demand from the system, and is characterized by part load performance curves. Various equations describe the pump’s operation, including calculations for volume flow rate, part load ratio, and pump power.

Overall, the description highlights the complexities and considerations involved in simulating steam systems, including the interactions and dependencies between various components, to accurately represent real-world scenarios within the EnergyPlus platform.The pump's nominal power is a user input to the model, represented by the equation P = PFrac × PNom. The shaft power is calculated as the product of the pump power and motor efficiency, which is necessary to determine the heat generated and delivered to the fluid being pumped. The equation used to calculate pump shaft power is PS = P × ηm. The model assumes that all heat generated and lost ends up in the fluid loop, a necessary assumption since EnergyPlus operates on a closed loop. The pump heat to the fluid, which raises the condensate temperature, is calculated using the pump motor efficiency defined by user input and the fractional motor loss to fluid. This is the amount of heat generated by the pump motor that is added to the fluid loop. The equation for pump heat to the fluid is PH = PS + (P − PS) × Fmf.

The shaft power relates to the increase in head through the pump to the loop operating pressure. The heat lost through the piping network due to frictional heat represents the heat gain by the fluid throughout the network. For simplicity, this heat is added along with the heat resulting from the pump motor. The difference between the pump power and the shaft power is the inefficiency of the pump, or the energy input into the pump that the motor converts to heat rather than mechanical energy. Some of this heat is added to the fluid being pumped. These terms are used in the PumpHeatToFluid equation for calculating PH.

A simple energy balance over the pump based on the pump inlet conditions and flow rate is used to calculate the pump outlet temperature. The condensate outlet temperature from the pump is slightly higher than the inlet due to the heat dissipation to the fluid steam during pumping action. The pump water outlet temperature is the boiler inlet temperature, calculated as Twout = Twin + PH / (ṁ × cp,w).

Pump control is an important part of the steam loop, utilizing the existing control structure from EnergyPlus to operate the condensate pump. The pump is simulated on the supply side of the loop after the demand side loop has determined the loop demand. 

Model assumptions acknowledge that a pump, as a mechanical device, causes the fluid temperature to rise. EnergyPlus assumes all pressure increase caused by the pump will be lost due to friction, added as heat to the fluid. This assumption is justified in steam systems due to the small volume flow rate of water in the loop.

The steam pipe serves as an "energy carrier," transferring node conditions from one point to another, forming a framework connecting equipment from the supply to the demand side. The steam pipe model in EnergyPlus supports additional properties like pressure and quality, unlike its water counterpart. The piping network in the steam system is assumed to perfectly distribute steam, return condensate, and remove air and non-condensable gases, with no losses occurring during transportation.

Correct equipment sizing is crucial in building simulation methods. EnergyPlus implements a sizing methodology that includes zone-by-zone heat balance load and air-flow calculations for multiple design days, significant user control, and system and plant level calculations of design heating and cooling capacities and fluid flow rates. This is managed by a sizing manager in the software module SizingManager, which performs tasks such as reading user sizing input, initializing design load and flow rate sequences, and calculating peak heating and cooling loads and flow rates.

HVAC Sizing Simulations improve the sizing of plant loops using the Coincident sizing option. The process involves determining necessary sizing analyses, setting up data logging, looping over sizing passes, and processing coincident plant size adjustments.

Zone design loads and air flow rates are determined by calculating space heating and cooling sensible and/or latent loads. The data is stored in various zone design data arrays, which include inputs from Sizing:Zone objects and results of zone design calculations for peak heating and cooling cases. The data includes zone design sensible and latent heating and cooling air mass flow rates, loads, air densities, and temperatures, among other parameters.The text describes various faults and modeling approaches in HVAC systems, including boilers, chillers, evaporative coolers, and demand management strategies.

This summary captures the essential equations and descriptions related to airflow through openings, providing a structured understanding of the principles and calculations involved in the AirflowNetwork model.Here is a structured version of the meaningful content extracted from the original text, with irrelevant details removed:

---

### AirflowNetwork Model Overview

The AirflowNetwork model provides a framework for calculating humidity ratios, sensible and latent loads, and airflow in HVAC systems. It involves various calculations and procedures to determine airflow and thermal loads in building zones.

#### Node Humidity Ratio Calculations

The humidity ratio distribution across a duct element at a given airflow rate and inlet air humidity ratio is calculated using the equation:

\[
\dot{m} \frac{dW}{dx} = UmP(W_\infty - W)
\]

Where:
- \(\dot{m}\) is the airflow rate [kg/s]
- \(P\) is the perimeter of a duct element [m]
- \(W\) is the humidity ratio [kg/kg]
- \(W_\infty\) is the humidity ratio of surrounding air [kg/kg]
- \(Um\) is the overall moisture transfer coefficient [kg/m²-s]

The outlet air humidity ratio at the end of the duct is given by:

\[
W_o = W_\infty + (W_i - W_\infty) \cdot \exp \left( -\frac{UmA}{\dot{m}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \(W_i\) is the inlet air humidity ratio [kg/kg]
- \(W_o\) is the outlet air humidity ratio [kg/kg]
- \(A\) is the surface area (Perimeter * Length) [m²]

#### Sensible and Latent Load Calculations

The sensible and latent loads in the AirflowNetwork model consider multizone airflows, duct conduction, leakage, infiltration, and mixing. These loads are integrated into the zone energy balance equations to determine zone temperatures and humidity ratios.

#### Supply Air Fan Control

The AirflowNetwork model supports different types of constant and variable volume fans. These include continuous fan with cycling compressor and cycling fan with cycling compressor. The choice of fan operation mode affects the calculation of zone loads.

#### Airflow Calculation Procedures

The AirflowNetwork model supports supply variable air volume fans and considers supply and return leaks. Airflow calculations are based on terminal flow rates and pressure resistance, with adjustments made to meet maximum fan flow rate constraints.

#### Integration with EnergyPlus

The AirflowNetwork model integrates with EnergyPlus by incorporating calculated loads into the heat balance equation. This integration affects the calculation of zone temperature and humidity ratios.

#### Single Sided Wind Pressure Coefficient Algorithm

The model calculates flow rates into rooms through single-sided openings by correlating with local flow conditions and pressure differences. The flow rate is influenced by mean and fluctuating pressure differences and shear layer mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The AirflowNetwork model provides a comprehensive approach to modeling airflow and thermal loads in building HVAC systems, integrating these calculations into the broader EnergyPlus simulation framework. It considers detailed aspects of airflow resistance, fan operation modes, and environmental influences like wind pressure.The unstructured text primarily discusses airflow modeling and control within buildings, particularly focusing on the AirflowNetwork model used in EnergyPlus. Here's a more structured version:

---

**AirflowNetwork Model Overview**

The AirflowNetwork model is used to simulate airflow within and around buildings, incorporating various factors such as pressure coefficients, wind speed, and flow rates. It is particularly designed to integrate with EnergyPlus, ensuring that the model is practically transparent to the user.

**Pressure Difference and Flow Rate**

The pressure difference (\(\Delta p\)) is crucial for calculating flow rates between openings. This pressure difference is related to flow rate by the equation:

\[
\Delta p_{12} = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 = \frac{1}{C_d^2} \left(\frac{Q}{A_{\text{eff}}V}\right)^2
\]

where \(A_{\text{eff}}\) is defined as:

\[
A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{A_1 A_2}{\sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2}}
\]

**Model Testing and Validation**

The AirflowNetwork model's accuracy was validated using wind tunnel data from CPP Wind Engineering & Air Quality Consultants. Experiments included pressure and flow rate measurements on a scale model building under various environmental conditions and building configurations.

**Occupant Ventilation Control**

This control in the AirflowNetwork model manages window operations based on several parameters, including minimum open/closed times, indoor thermal comfort, and probabilistic controls for opening and closing actions. The procedures are as follows:

1. **Open Elapsed Time Check:** Ensures a window remains open if the elapsed time is below a minimum threshold.
2. **Closed Elapsed Time Check:** Ensures a window remains closed if the elapsed time is below a minimum threshold.
3. **Thermal Comfort Check:** Utilizes outdoor temperature data to calculate a comfort temperature and band, determining whether windows should open or close based on current indoor conditions.

**Opening and Closing Probability Control**

These controls use probabilistic methods to determine window operations. The model checks elapsed times, occupancy, and setpoints, using schedules to calculate probabilities for opening or closing windows.

**Pressure Control**

Pressure control within zones is achieved by adjusting either exhaust fan flow rates or relief air flow rates to meet setpoint pressures. The model determines flow rates by running simulations with varied flow rates and uses these results to achieve desired pressure conditions.

**Duct Sizing**

The model provides two methods for sizing ducts: based on maximum velocity and pressure loss. The duct diameter and cross-section area are calculated to ensure adequate airflow while minimizing pressure losses.

This structured text captures the key elements of the original content, focusing on the AirflowNetwork model's purpose, methodology, testing, and control mechanisms for airflow and pressure within buildings.Room Air Models

The group of models described in this section is used to account for non-uniform room air temperatures that may occur within the interior air volume of a zone. These models are accessed using the RoomAirModelType input object. RoomAir modeling was added to EnergyPlus starting with Version 1.2. Although there are many types of analyses (comfort, indoor air quality, etc.) that might benefit from localized modeling of how room air varies across space, most of the room air models in EnergyPlus only address the distribution of temperature within the zone. This allows surface heat transfer and air system heat balance calculations to be made, taking into account natural thermal stratification of air and different types of intentional air distribution designs such as under-floor and side-wall displacement ventilation that extract room air at higher-than-mean temperatures. The exception is the RoomAirflowNetwork model, which integrates the AirflowNetwork model and applies the nodal airflow model within zones.

Note that EnergyPlus does not have completely general methods of modeling room air applicable to every conceivable type of airflow that might occur in a zone. Such models (e.g., RANS-CFD) are too computationally expensive to use with EnergyPlus for the foreseeable future. The models available in EnergyPlus offer only limited modeling capabilities for select room airflow configurations. Also, because the complete mixing model for room air has long been the standard in building energy simulation, there is not currently a consensus on how to best model non-uniform air temperatures in buildings. Therefore, it is up to the user to have a good understanding of when, where, and how to apply the room air models available in EnergyPlus.

EnergyPlus offers the different types of air models listed below along with the input objects associated with the use of that model:

1. **Well-Mixed**: Applicable to all zones, no specific input objects required.
2. **User Defined**: For zones where the user has prior knowledge of the temperature pattern.
3. **One-Node Displacement Ventilation (Mundt)**: For displacement ventilation in typical office-type zones.
4. **Three-Node Displacement Ventilation (UCSD)**: For displacement ventilation.
5. **Under-Floor Air Distribution Interior Model (UCSD)**: For interior zones served by a UFAD system.
6. **Under-Floor Air Distribution Exterior Model (UCSD)**: For exterior zones served by a UFAD system.
7. **UCSD Cross Ventilation**: For cross ventilation.
8. **RoomAirflowNetwork**: For room air model using AirflowNetwork.

The room air models are coupled to the heat balance routines using a framework described by Griffith and Chen (2004). Their framework was modified to include features needed for a comprehensive program for annual energy modeling. The coupling framework was extended to allow for exhaust air flows, in addition to air system return flows. The inside face temperature calculation is modified by rewriting the zone air temperature with an additional subscript for the surface index. 

User-Defined Room Air Temperatures

The input object RoomAir:TemperaturePattern:UserDefined allows users to define the air temperature pattern expected in the zone. With these models, the pattern is generally set beforehand and does not respond to conditions that evolve during the simulation. The patterns defined by the object ‘RoomAir:TemperaturePattern:SurfaceMapping’ are straightforward, where the user directly inputs values for each surface. Other patterns focus on temperature changes in the vertical direction.

One-Node Displacement Ventilation Room Air Model

The input object RoomAirSettings:OneNodeDisplacementVentilation provides a simple model for displacement ventilation. Mundt (1996) points out that a floor air heat balance provides a simple and accurate method of modeling the temperature near the floor surface. The slope of a linear temperature gradient can be obtained by adding a second upper air temperature value from the usual overall air system cooling load heat balance. 

Three-Node Displacement Ventilation Room Air Model

The input object RoomAirSettings:ThreeNodeDisplacementVentilation provides a simple model for heat transfer and vertical temperature profile prediction in displacement ventilation. The use of three nodes allows for improved prediction of thermal comfort and overall building energy performance in low-energy cooling strategies that use stratified ventilation flows. The UCSD Displacement Ventilation Model is one of the non-uniform zone models provided through the Room Air Manager in EnergyPlus. 

Displacement Ventilation

A DV system contrasts with a conventional forced air system by delivering conditioned air at floor level and low velocity to minimize mixing and establish a vertical temperature gradient. The incoming air displaces the air above it, which is exhausted through ceiling level vents. In DV, a noticeable interface occurs between the occupied zone and a mixed hot layer near the ceiling. DV systems often use 100% outside air, making them best suited to interior spaces with moderate loads.The text discusses various studies and concepts in fluid mechanics and building energy modeling. Key studies include:

5. **Fluid Dynamics of Underfloor Air Distribution** - Q. Liu's 2006 PhD dissertation on air distribution systems.

The text also delves into hybrid modeling for building energy simulations, integrating physics-based and data-driven approaches. This model addresses challenges in estimating parameters such as interior thermal mass, air infiltration rates, and occupancy counts, which significantly impact building performance. The hybrid model leverages measured data to refine these estimates, improving energy simulation accuracy. It discusses zone balance algorithms for heat, moisture, and CO2, emphasizing the inverse modeling approach to derive unknown parameters using measurable data like temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations.

Hybrid modeling aims to enhance energy retrofit practices by providing user-friendly environments and more accurate energy savings estimates. It addresses uncertainties in building modeling, such as the dynamic nature of air infiltration and occupant behavior. The text outlines methods for modeling internal thermal mass and infiltration airflow, highlighting the importance of accurate data for reliable energy simulation outcomes.The text outlines the design and modeling of air system distribution terminals, focusing on the methods and calculations for sizing and operating systems like four-pipe beams and dual duct systems in HVAC applications.

### Air System Distribution Terminals

#### Four-Pipe Beam System Design
Four-pipe beam systems use overhead beam type air terminals that induce room air to flow over a convector by directing primary supply air through special nozzles. The cooling and heating capacities of the beam’s convector are linked to the primary flow rate, which must satisfy ventilation, cooling, and heating requirements. The sizing method uses a non-linear solver in EnergyPlus to find appropriate primary supply air flow rates. The solver minimizes residuals by evaluating trial flow rates against the design load. Adjustments are made to central system sizing based on four-pipe beam outcomes.

#### Cooled Beam Unit
Cooled beam systems are hybrid water-air systems used for sensible cooling, often using constant flow and temperature for ventilation and latent load requirements. These units, both passive and active, rely on convective cooling. The model, based on the DOE-2 framework, calculates cooling outputs and coil heat transfer coefficients using specified parameters and empirical relationships.

#### Dual Duct Systems
Dual duct systems, both constant (DDCAV) and variable air volume (DDVAV), manage precise temperature control. DDCAV systems adjust mixing of hot and cold air streams to meet zone demands, while DDVAV systems offer energy efficiency by varying air flow rates. These systems calculate hot and cold deck mass flow rates to satisfy zone loads, using known parameters for temperature, specific heats, and design mass flow rates.

### Implementation and Control
- **Model Input:** Users input design values such as air and water temperatures, flow rates, and system parameters. Autosizing options are available.
- **Simulation and Control:** Simulation involves calculating necessary air and water flow rates to meet heating/cooling demands. Iterative methods solve nonlinear model equations to ensure balance between air-side and water-side cooling powers.
- **Adjustment and Reporting:** Adjustments in system sizing are necessary to account for differences in design flow rates, with detailed reports generated for system components like AirLoopHVAC.

The documentation provides guidelines for converting manufacturer data into model inputs and emphasizes the importance of correct input parameters in achieving effective system sizing and performance.Certainly! Here's a structured and meaningful presentation of the text, with unnecessary details removed:

---

**Air System Simulation and Control**

The air system simulation begins by determining the required air mass flow rate to satisfy heating or cooling demands. This involves calculating specific heats and the temperature differences between the zone and inlet air. The process adjusts the air mass flow rate based on outdoor air requirements, using an outdoor air fraction to ensure the correct amount of air enters the zone.

**Outdoor Air and Damper Control**

The outdoor air input adjusts the terminal unit air mass flow rate to ensure the correct amount of outdoor air enters the zone, staying within specified flow rate constraints. The damper position determines the fraction of maximum flow, adjusting based on whether the flow rate is reset to maximum or minimum.

**Dual Duct VAV Cooling System**

The AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir model is used for dedicated outside air combined with recirculated air for cooling. This system has two inlets for outdoor and recirculated air, which are mixed to meet ventilation and cooling requirements. The model calculates the required outdoor air flow rate and cool air flow rate to meet cooling setpoints, adjusting based on occupancy to model demand-controlled ventilation.

**Boiler Simulation**

**Simple Hot Water Boiler**

The Boiler:HotWater model requires nominal capacity and thermal efficiency inputs. The boiler efficiency can be represented by a curve, which adjusts based on part-load ratio and operating temperature. Parasitic electric power is calculated based on the part-load ratio.

**Steam Boiler**

A steam boiler, a key component of steam heating systems, operates to maintain desired loop temperatures. The mass flow rate of steam through the boiler matches the heating demand. The boiler adds energy to the water stream, consuming fuel and accounting for efficiency losses. The model provides a first-order approximation of performance, with control algorithms adjusting boiler load to meet demand conditions.

**Model Assumptions**

The EnergyPlus boiler model assumes the steam boiler operates to maintain saturation temperature, independent of fuel type, providing a simple yet effective simulation for building systems.

**Generator and Chiller Flow Calculations**

The inlet and outlet node temperatures of the generator are calculated based on the heat input, mass flow rate, and the specific heat of water. The calculations depend on the Chiller Flow Mode:

- **Constant Flow Chillers:**
  - \(\dot{m}_{generator} = \dot{m}_{generator, \text{max}}\)
  
- **Variable Flow Chillers:**
  - \(\dot{m}_{generator} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{generator}}{C_p,\text{water} \cdot \Delta T_{generator}}\)
  - \(T_{generator,\text{out}} = T_{generator,\text{in}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{generator}}{\dot{m}_{generator} \cdot C_p, \text{water}}\)

Where:
- \(\dot{m}_{generator}\) is the generator hot water mass flow rate (kg/s)

**Combustion Turbine Chiller**

The `Chiller:CombustionTurbine` model is an empirical model based on the BLAST program, using polynomial equations to generate performance curves. The open centrifugal chiller is driven directly by a gas turbine, modeled as a standard vapor compression refrigeration cycle. The refrigerant undergoes the following processes:

1. Compression by a centrifugal compressor.
2. Condensation in a refrigerant-to-water condenser.
3. Pressure reduction through a throttling valve.

1. Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature
2. Fuel Input to Cooling Output Ratio Functions
3. Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Functions

The cooling capacity and efficiency are calculated using biquadratic curves, while the heating capacity and efficiency use additional performance curves.

This structured text organizes the information into clearer sections, focusing on the main components and calculations involved in chiller and generator operations.The text provides a detailed explanation of a simulation model for electric chillers, specifically the Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR model, which is used to simulate the thermal performance and power consumption of electric liquid chillers. This model, developed as part of the CoolToolsTM project by Hydeman et al., is similar to the EnergyPlus' Chiller:Electric:EIR model but offers potentially improved accuracy for chillers with variable-speed compressor motors and variable condenser water flow applications.

### Key Components of the Model:
1. **Performance Curves:**
   - **Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve:** This biquadratic curve uses the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature to determine the full-load cooling capacity at different temperature conditions.
   - **Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve:** Also a biquadratic curve, it calculates the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature.
   - **Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve:** This curve parameterizes the EIR variation and uses the part-load ratio as an independent variable. It can be a bicubic curve or a custom curve depending on the specific data available.

2. **Calculation Process:**
   - The model calculates the available cooling capacity (`Qavail`) based on reference conditions and current operating conditions.
   - It adjusts the evaporator heat transfer rate to meet the setpoint temperature for the leaving chilled water.

Overall, this model offers a comprehensive approach to simulating chiller performance, requiring detailed performance data to ensure accuracy and reliability in predicting chiller operation under varying conditions.**Chiller Operation and Energy Consumption**

**False Loading and Chiller Compressor Power Calculation**

False loading, such as hot-gas bypass, occurs when the Part Load Ratio (PLR) is less than the minimum unloading ratio. The false loading on the chiller is calculated using a revised PLR and is reported as an output variable:

\[ \dot{Q}_{\text{falseloading}} = Q_{\text{avail}} \times (PLR) \times (\text{ChillerCyclingRatio}) - \dot{Q}_{\text{evap}} \]

The electrical power consumption for the chiller compressor(s) at any simulation time step is calculated using:

\[ P_{\text{chiller}} = \frac{Q_{\text{avail}}}{\text{COP}_{\text{ref}}} \times (\text{ChillerEIRFTemp}) \times (\text{ChillerEIRFPLR}) \times (\text{ChillerCyclingRatio}) \]

Where:

- \( P_{\text{chiller}} \) is the chiller compressor power (W).
- \( \text{COP}_{\text{ref}} \) is the reference coefficient of performance (W/W).

**Condenser Heat Rejection**

The heat rejected by the chiller condenser includes the heat transferred in the evaporator plus the compressor's electrical energy consumption. For electric chillers with hermetic compressors, all compressor energy is rejected by the condenser (compressor motor efficiency = 1.0). For chillers with semi-hermetic or open compressors, only a portion is rejected. The heat transfer rate for the chiller condenser is calculated as:

\[ \dot{Q}_{\text{cond}} = (P_{\text{chiller}} \times \text{eff}_{\text{motor}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{evap}} + \dot{Q}_{\text{falseloading}} \]

Where:

- \( \dot{Q}_{\text{cond}} \) is the condenser heat transfer rate (W).
- \( \text{eff}_{\text{motor}} \) is the compressor motor efficiency.

**Final Calculations**

The total heat transfer energy for the condenser and evaporator, as well as the total electric energy consumed by the chiller compressor motor(s) and condenser fan(s), are determined using:

\[ Q_{\text{cond}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{cond}} \times \text{TimeStepSys} \times 3600 \]
\[ Q_{\text{evap}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{evap}} \times \text{TimeStepSys} \times 3600 \]
\[ E_{\text{chiller}} = P_{\text{chiller}} \times \text{TimeStepSys} \times 3600 \]
\[ E_{\text{cond}} = P_{\text{cond}} \times \text{TimeStepSys} \times 3600 \]

Where:

- \( Q_{\text{cond}} \) is the chiller condenser heat transfer energy (J).
- \( Q_{\text{evap}} \) is the chiller evaporator cooling energy (J).
- \( E_{\text{chiller}} \) is the chiller (compressor) electric energy (J).
- \( E_{\text{cond}} \) is the chiller condenser fan electric energy (J).
- \( \text{TimeStepSys} \) is the HVAC system simulation time step (hr).
- 3600 is a conversion factor (sec/hr).

**Ice Thermal Storage Model**

**Overview**

The model simulates the performance of an ice storage tank. It is based on a simple simulation where ice builds up on the outside of tubes carrying brine or glycol solution from the chiller. The tank is controlled using the PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint scheme.

**Charging and Discharging**

Charging occurs when the entering water temperature is greater than -1°C, and the requested charging rate is less than the storage capacity. Discharging occurs when the entering water temperature is less than 1°C, and the requested discharge rate is less than the remaining charged storage capacity.

**Charging Algorithm**

During charging, the unit charges at the maximum rate until completely charged, occurring during off-peak hours. The flow rate through the device equals the flow to the component unless flow is reduced to top off the tank at the end of the charge cycle.**Algorithm Outline for Ice Thermal Storage**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set initial temperature \( T_o = T_{set} \).

2. **Charging Process**:
   - Calculate Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD*).
   - Determine heat transfer rate \( q^* \) from the charging equation for the current percent charged.
   - Calculate a new outlet temperature \( T_{o,new} \) and compare it to \( T_o \).
   - Use \( T_{o,new} \) to calculate a new LMTD* and iterate until \( T_o \) converges to an acceptable level.
   - Charging continues in subsequent time steps until the ice storage unit is fully charged. If running a chiller would overcharge the tank, reduce the flow to the tank while maintaining the setpoint temperature.

3. **Discharging Algorithm**:
   - During discharging, some flow might bypass the ice storage unit. Use initial guesses to determine current performance.
   - Solve two main equations: one from user input characterizing the unit output and another for energy balance: \( q = \dot{m}C_p(T_i - T_o) \).
   - Use setpoint temperature as initial guess for \( T_o \).
   - Iterate until \( T_o \) converges. If \( T_o \geq T_{set} \), the load is met or slightly exceeded. If \( T_o < T_{set} \), bypass some flow to adjust capacity.

**Other Ice Thermal Storage Options**

- Thermal storage can also be integrated with packaged air-conditioning units.

- **Latent Capacity Degradation**: The latent capacity of a DX coil can degrade under part-load conditions, especially when the fan operates continuously. The model incorporates algorithms to account for moisture buildup and evaporation, affecting the coil's dehumidification performance.

### Important Parameters and Equations
- **Moisture Buildup and Evaporation**: The model considers the time it takes for moisture to condense on the coil and how it evaporates when the coil cycles off. Parameters like `t_wet` (time for condensate removal) and `γ` (moisture evaporation rate ratio) are crucial for this analysis.
- **Equation Utilization**: Various equations are used throughout the model to calculate enthalpy, humidity ratio, and temperature under different fan and coil operating conditions.

This summary captures the essential details of the heating coil and heat pump models, focusing on their operation, inputs, and calculations related to capacity, efficiency, and defrosting.The heating strategy involves adjusting the part-load ratio to account for the additional heating load (Qdefrost) generated during defrost operation. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, Qdefrost is set to zero. The part-load fraction correlation for the heating coil is used to calculate electrical power draw, accounting for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part-load ratio (PLR) is defined as:

\[ PLR = \min(1.0, PLR + \frac{Qdefrost}{Qtotal}) \]

The part-load fraction is calculated by:

\[ PartLoadFrac = a + b \times PLR + c \times (PLR)^2 + d \times (PLR)^3 \]

The average compressor and outdoor fan power during the simulation time step is given by:

\[ Pheating = (Qtotal) \times (EIR) \times (PLR) \times PartLoadFrac \times InputPowerMultiplier \]

Here, Pheating is the average compressor and outdoor fan power, Qtotal is the total heating capacity, and EIR (Energy Input Ratio) is defined as:

These ratings include High and Low Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity and Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF). The standard ratings require evaluation at specific operating conditions. If the performance curves cannot be evaluated at required conditions, a standard rating value is calculated at user-specified curve limits, with a warning message.

The High Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity is calculated as:

\[ \dot{Q}_{HighStandardRating,Net} = \dot{Q}_{HighStandardRating} + Fan Power, Rated \]

where \(\dot{Q}_{HighStandardRating}\) is the total standard heating capacity. Similarly, the Low Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity is calculated as:

Depending on this inclusion, compressor power is calculated by subtracting fan power and possibly condenser pump power from the heating power.

2. **Evaporator Cooling Capacity**: The total cooling capacity is affected by user inputs for pump heat and condenser pump heat. The capacity is calculated by subtracting compressor and pump powers from the heating capacity.

4. **DX Coil Performance**: The performance of DX coils, both single-speed and variable refrigerant flow (VRF), is described. The VRF model adapts the single-speed model to account for variable-speed compressor operation, altering the refrigerant flow and affecting SHR and ADP.

5. **Model Outputs**: Various output variables are calculated, such as DX coil total heating and cooling rates, electric power consumption, and runtime fractions. These outputs depend on factors like part load ratios and system time steps.

6. **Cooling Coil Modulation**: The DX cooling coil model uses performance curves to predict total cooling capacity under different conditions. These curves account for air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures and air flow rates.

7. **Condenser Options**: The model allows for different condenser configurations, including air-cooled and evaporative-cooled options. Each configuration impacts the air temperature entering the condenser, which is crucial for performance calculations.

8. **Humidity and Temperature Considerations**: The model calculates humidity ratios and temperatures to determine the operational state of the coils, whether they are wet or dry, and adjusts the cooling capacity calculations accordingly.

This structured text summarizes the control logic and modeling of HVAC components, focusing on air flow control, energy recovery ventilators, and baseboard heaters within the context of energy simulation.Sure, here is a structured text derived from the provided unstructured content:

---

**Water Baseboard Heater**

This model utilizes radiation similar to high-temperature radiant heaters. It calculates a UA value using the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) method, based on standard conditions for both fluids provided by the user. The overall energy balances account for the heat exchange between the water loop and zone air. Once the UA value is determined, the model uses an effectiveness-NTU method to simulate heat transfer between water and zone air. 

**Inputs**

- Unique identifying name
- Availability schedule
- Water inlet and outlet nodes
- Rated capacity
- Average water temperature
- Water mass flow rate
- Standard inlet air temperature

The model can autosize the rated capacity if manufacturer data is unavailable. The UA value characterizes total heat transfer, including convective heat transfer from water to tube, conduction through materials, natural convection, and radiation to zone surfaces.

**Simulation and Control**

The UA value is determined based on rated heating capacities from manufacturers. During simulation, this UA value is used to determine heating output. The model assumes standard conditions such as water flow rate and inlet air temperature for UA calculations.

**Radiant Heat Transfer**

Radiant heat distribution requires user input of fractions incident on people and surfaces, which must sum to unity. The model allows radiant energy distribution to up to 20 surfaces.

**Electric Baseboard Heater with Radiation and Convection**

This model uses electric resistance heating, impacting surface heat balances and thermal comfort. The remaining convective gains are distributed throughout the space, affecting the zone air heat balance.

**Inputs**

- Unique identifying name
- Availability schedule
- Capacity and efficiency
- Radiant heat distribution fractions

**Simulation and Control**

During operation, the model attempts to meet the heating load within its capacity. Radiant heat transfer to people and surfaces is calculated and distributed accordingly. The model assumes no heat storage in the baseboard unit.

The model distributes radiant heat to the appropriate surfaces and people in the zone and convective heat addition to the air. Surface heat balances are recalculated to account for the radiant heat added by the baseboard unit. Radiant heat incident on people is considered in thermal comfort models and is converted to convection to the zone. The load met by the baseboard heater is calculated using the equation: 

\[ q_{\text{req}} = (q_{\text{surf,c}} - q_{\text{surf,z}}) + q_{\text{conv}} + q_{\text{people}} \]

where \( q_{\text{surf,c}} \) is convection from surfaces to air with baseboard radiation, \( q_{\text{surf,z}} \) is convection without baseboard radiation, \( q_{\text{conv}} \) is convective heat transfer from the heater, and \( q_{\text{people}} \) is radiant heat to people.

Cooling towers are modeled using Merkel's theory. The model simulates performance for single-speed, two-speed, and variable-speed cooling towers based on effectiveness-NTU relationships for counterflow heat exchangers. The model accounts for tower performance in the "free convection" regime and assumes a simple linear interpolation for part-load operation. 

For single-speed cooling towers, capacity control can be fan cycling or fluid bypass. In fluid bypass mode, some water is cooled through tower media while the rest bypasses, mixing to meet the exit temperature setpoint. If the exiting water temperature is lower than the setpoint, the tower operates in fluid bypass mode. Evaporative fluid coolers are similar but differ in performance input methods.

Cooling tower performance is described by the equation:

\[ \dot{Q}_{\text{total}} = U \cdot A \cdot (T_w - T_{wb}) \]

where \( U \) is the heat transfer coefficient, \( A \) is the surface area, \( T_w \) is the water temperature, and \( T_{wb} \) is the wet-bulb temperature.

The effectiveness of the cooling tower is defined as:

\[ \epsilon = 1 - \exp \left( \frac{-\text{NTU} \cdot (1 - \frac{\dot{C}_w}{\dot{C}_a})}{1 - \frac{\dot{C}_w}{\dot{C}_a} \cdot \exp(-\text{NTU} \cdot (1 - \frac{\dot{C}_w}{\dot{C}_a}))} \right) \]

where \( \dot{C}_w \) and \( \dot{C}_a \) are the heat capacity rates of water and air, respectively.

The steady-state exiting water temperature is calculated iteratively using the overall heat transfer coefficient-area product and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger. The model seeks to maintain the exiting water temperature at or below a setpoint, using either free convection or fan operation.

For variable-speed cooling towers, fan power is calculated from the airflow rate ratio using a design fan power and a performance curve.

This structured version retains the relevant technical content while removing references, directories, and redundant information.The text describes the operation and efficiency of various evaporative coolers used in HVAC systems within the EnergyPlus simulation model. There are several types of evaporative coolers discussed, each with specific characteristics and operational models:

1. **Direct Evaporative Cooler**: This model uses a rigid media evaporative pad to provide direct stage cooling by adiabatic saturation of air. The process lowers the dry-bulb temperature while increasing the moisture content of the air. The efficiency of the direct evaporative process is less than 100%, and the leaving dry-bulb temperature can be determined using the saturation efficiency.

2. **Dry Coil Indirect Evaporative Cooler**: This uses a rigid media pad for adiabatic cooling. The secondary air is cooled through a heat exchanger and then exhausted. The dry coil design prevents mineral deposits on the heat exchange surface, maintaining its efficiency. The dry-bulb temperature leaving the evaporative media is calculated based on pad geometry and secondary airflow.

3. **Wet Coil Indirect Evaporative Cooler**: Water is sprayed directly on the heat exchanger tubes, allowing simultaneous heat and mass transfer. This process is not adiabatic and can result in higher efficiency than the dry coil due to increased heat transfer on the tube surface. Over time, mineral deposits can decrease the heat exchanger's effectiveness.

4. **Two-Stage Direct/Indirect Evaporative Cooler**: Combines either a wet or dry coil indirect evaporative cooler with a direct evaporative cooler. This configuration is used for total comfort cooling and follows a combined process of sensible and adiabatic cooling.

5. **Indirect Evaporative Cooler Special Research Model**: This model is designed for improved performance in data centers and hybrid applications, incorporating variable speed fans and pumps. It can operate in both wet and dry modes, adjusting to meet a dry-bulb temperature setpoint. The model includes performance curves for effectiveness, fan power, and pump power.

Each cooler model involves specific equations and parameters to calculate efficiencies and temperature changes, relying on factors such as airflow rate, pad geometry, and psychrometric conditions. Maintenance and operational conditions, such as mineral deposits and airflow mismatches, can affect the long-term efficiency of these systems.The text describes various aspects of energy efficiency and control systems related to fans, motors, and unitary systems in HVAC applications. It includes formulas and coefficients for calculating efficiency, fan energy index (FEI), and motor performance. The document includes efficiency curve coefficients, system total efficiency calculations, and the concept of heat loss to air. It also explains the Fan Energy Index (FEI), which is a metric for comparing fan energy performance, and how it is used in regulatory standards and utility rebate programs.

Additionally, the text outlines the calculation methods for reference fan electrical input power and motor efficiency, and discusses the role of different components in a unitary system, such as fans, heating coils, cooling coils, and reheat coils. The control methods for unitary systems, including setpoint-based and load-based controls, are also covered. These systems are designed to optimize the operation of various components to meet specific heating or cooling loads.

Key concepts such as part-load ratio, sensible and latent load requirements, and control zone air flow fraction are discussed in the context of how they affect system performance and efficiency. The document also details the procedures for calculating cooling loads and sensible cooling energy rates for unitary systems, emphasizing the importance of efficient system design and operation in HVAC applications.In the section above, the calculation methods for multi or variable speed heating coil models are described. The model determines the sensible heating energy rate delivered by the unitary system to the zones being served under various conditions. It considers full-load conditions at the highest speed when the DX heating coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, the sensible heating energy rate is zero when the compressor is OFF. However, if the fan runs continuously regardless of coil operation, the sensible heating energy rate will not be zero when the compressor is OFF.

The calculation involves modeling the supply air fan, the DX cooling coil, the DX heating coil, and the supplemental heating coil. For full load and DX heating coil OFF conditions, the sensible heating energy rate is calculated using specific formulas that account for air mass flow rate, enthalpy differences, and sensible load differences.

If the unitary system’s DX heating coil output at the highest speed is insufficient to meet the heating load, the remaining load is passed to the supplemental heating coil. If the outdoor air temperature is below the minimum for compressor operation, the compressor is turned off, and the entire heating load is passed to the supplemental heating coil.

When the total heating load is less than the sensible heating rate at the highest speed, the model calculates the sensible heating energy rate at Speed 1 and estimates the cycling ratio for the unitary system. The part-load performance of the DX heating coil and the supply air fan heat varies based on heating coil operation, requiring iterative calculations until the unitary system’s heating output matches the heating load within a convergence tolerance of 0.001.

For cases where Speed 1 operation meets the heating load, the speed ratio is set to zero, and the speed number is equal to 1. If full load at Speed 1 is insufficient, the cycling ratio is set to 1.0, and the heating speed is increased. The speed ratio is then estimated for the unitary system.

The unitary system can also simulate a system capable of maintaining low fan speed through a range of loads, similar to single zone variable-air-volume control. This model is applicable to specific coil types and is used to maintain the system outlet air temperature within specified limits.

High humidity control is available with options like MultiMode and CoolReheat, which involve heat exchangers and supplemental heating coils to meet the zone latent load. The model calculates part-load ratios iteratively to meet both sensible and moisture loads.

Waste heat calculations are performed when multi-speed cooling and heating coils are specified, and heat recovery is active. The outlet node temperature of heat recovery is determined based on recoverable waste heat.

When modeling multi-speed fans and water coils, the coil’s capacity is modulated accordingly.The text describes the functioning and control mechanisms of HVAC systems, specifically focusing on unitary systems and forced-air furnaces. Here is a structured summary:

### Unitary System Control
- **Capacity Control**: The system uses two-position coil control, varying fan speed while operating coils at maximum water flow. The water control valve closes when there is no load.
- **Part-load Ratio**: Calculated when the system cycles between minimum fan speed and off-position. It determines the average water flow rate.
- **Speed Ratio**: Calculated when the supply fan cycles between stages. Formulas are provided for both speed and part-load ratios.

### Forced-Air Furnace and Central Air Conditioning
- **Overview**: The system integrates components like fans and coils. The HeatCool version includes a DX cooling coil and optional reheat coil.
- **Configuration**: Can be set up with either a blow-through or draw-through fan. The coil order is standardized for uniformity.
- **System Operation**: Controlled by a thermostat in a central zone. The air flow fraction through the control zone is crucial for calculating the total load.
- **Fan Operation Modes**: Includes cycling and continuous modes, with specific schedules to denote the mode.

### HeatOnly Configuration
- **Components**: Comprises a fan and a heating coil.
- **Load Calculation**: Based on the control zone, the load is adjusted according to the air flow fraction.
- **Heating Capacity**: Evaluated by modeling the fan and heating coil, considering both full-load and coil-off scenarios.
- **Part-load Ratio**: Calculated iteratively to ensure the furnace's output matches the load within a set tolerance.

- **Cooling Load Calculation**: Similar to the HeatOnly configuration, adjusted for cooling demands.
- **Economizer Functionality**: Utilized if available, to meet loads with outside air before engaging the compressor.
- **Cooling Output Evaluation**: Modeled similarly to heating, considering full-load and coil-off conditions.

### General Notes
- **System Coordination**: The furnace model ensures proper coordination among components.
- **Iteration and Tolerance**: Iterative calculations are used to achieve the desired output, with a fixed convergence tolerance.

This structured text retains the meaningful content from the original unstructured text, focusing on essential operations and calculations involved in HVAC system modeling.Here is a structured and meaningful version of the provided text, with unnecessary details removed:

---

**Zone Inlet and System Mass Flow Rate**

The equation for the zone inlet and system mass flow rate involves calculating the sensible load difference between the system output node and the zone inlet node when the heating coil is off. This is expressed as:

\[
\Delta_{\text{sen, coil off}} = \dot{m}_{\text{Zone Inlet Frac}}(h_{\text{Out, coil off}} - h_{\text{Zone Inlet}}) + \dot{m}_{\text{coil off}} - \dot{m}_{\text{Zone Inlet Frac}}(h_{\text{Out, coil off}} - h_{\text{Control Zone}})
\]

**Part-Load Ratio for the Furnace**

With the sensible cooling energy rates and the total sensible cooling load to be met by the system calculated, the part-load ratio for the furnace is estimated as:

\[
\text{PartLoadRatio} = \max\left(0.0, \frac{\left| \text{FurnaceCoolingLoad} - \text{NoCoolOutput} \right|}{\left| \text{FullCoolOutput} - \text{NoCoolOutput} \right|}\right)
\]

The part-load performance of the DX cooling coil is typically non-linear, and the supply air fan heat varies based on the cooling coil operation. Iterative calculations are performed to match the furnace's cooling output with the cooling load to be met within a fixed convergence tolerance of 0.001.

**High Humidity Control with HeatCool Configuration**

An optional reheat coil allows the furnace to control high zone humidity levels. The system is controlled to maintain the relative humidity in the control zone below a specified setpoint. The furnace operates at the cooling air flow rate when a zone heating load is present, as determined by the zone thermostat. The dehumidification control type can be specified as None, MultiMode, or CoolReheat.

**Unitary Systems**

The CBVAV unitary system is a compound object made of components such as an outside air mixer, DX cooling coil, heating coil, and a supply air fan. It conditions one or more zones, controlled by thermostats located in each zone. The system operates based on a priority control input, which determines the mode of operation as either Cooling Priority, Heating Priority, or Zone Priority.

**Operating Mode**

The CBVAV system can only cool or heat the air for any HVAC simulation time step. It operates for the entire simulation time step, and the supply air fan continues to operate at a user-specified flow rate even when the coils cycle off. The operating mode is determined based on the zone cooling and heating loads, as well as the priority control mode specified by the user.

This text retains the core concepts and calculations related to the system's operation, part-load ratios, humidity control, and unitary system behavior.The text describes the operation and modeling of a Changeover-Bypass Variable Air Volume (CBVAV) system and an air-to-air heat pump system used in HVAC applications. Here's a structured summary of the key points:

### CBVAV System Operation

#### Modes of Operation
- **Floating Mode**: When both cooling and heating requirements are zero, zones are allowed to float, meaning no heating or cooling is provided.
- **Cooling Mode**: If cooling and heating requirements are identical and non-zero, cooling is selected as the operating mode.

#### Bypass Duct Mixer Node Calculations
- The CBVAV system uses constant-air-volume equipment to provide variable air volume by employing a bypass duct. Air conditions at the bypass duct mixer node are calculated based on the inlet air, required outlet air conditions, and the fraction of bypassed air.

#### Cooling and Heating Operations
- **Cooling**: A target outlet air temperature is calculated to operate at maximum air flow rate, and iterative calculations are used to find the DX compressor's part-load ratio.
- **Heating**: Similar to cooling, but uses the maximum target supply air temperature to control the system. 

#### Special Cases
- **Floating Operation**: If no cooling or heating is needed, the system allows temperatures to float. Special cases are handled to prevent overshooting zone temperature setpoints.

#### Air Flow and Temperature Limits
- User-specified minimum and maximum outlet air temperatures are used to control the system during cooling and heating operations.

### Air Flow Calculations
- The system operates based on user-specified or autosized air flow rates, adjusting for different operating modes (cooling, heating, or floating).

### Energy Calculations
- The system reports heating or cooling rates, energy delivered, and power consumption. Sensible, latent, and total energy transfer rates are calculated, with separate reporting for cooling and heating.

### Air-to-Air Heat Pump System

#### Overview
- The heat pump consists of an on/off or constant volume fan, a DX cooling coil, a DX heating coil, and a supplemental heating coil. It serves multiple zones but is controlled by a thermostat in a single "control" zone.

#### Operation Modes
- The fan can operate in cycling or continuous modes, controlled by a schedule. Cycling fan mode is used when the fan operates only with the coil, while continuous mode runs the fan constantly.

#### Cooling Operation
- If cooling is needed, the model calculates the total sensible cooling load and checks for an economizer. If conditions are favorable, the fan alone may be used before engaging the compressor.

### Summary
The CBVAV and heat pump systems are intricate components of HVAC design, allowing for precise control over air temperature and flow to meet the heating and cooling demands of different zones. They use a combination of fixed and variable air volumes, iterative calculations, and energy transfer metrics to optimize performance.The air properties and mass flow rate from their inlet nodes to their outlet nodes are considered for each case (full load and DX cooling coil OFF). The sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the heat pump is calculated as follows:

1. **Full Cool Output**: \( \text{Full Cool Output} = (\dot{m}_{\text{full load}})(h_{\text{out, full load}} - h_{\text{control zone}})HR_{\text{min}} - \Delta_{\text{sen, full load}} \)

2. **No Cool Output**: \( \text{No Cool Output} = (\dot{m}_{\text{coil off}})(h_{\text{out, coil off}} - h_{\text{control zone}})HR_{\text{min}} - \Delta_{\text{sen, coil off}} \)

Where:

- \(\dot{m}_{\text{full load}}\) is the air mass flow rate through the heat pump at full-load conditions (kg/s).
- \(h_{\text{out, full load}}\) is the enthalpy of air exiting the heat pump at full-load conditions (J/kg).
- \(h_{\text{control zone}}\) is the enthalpy of air leaving the control zone (J/kg).
- \(HR_{\text{min}}\) are the enthalpies evaluated at a constant humidity ratio.
- \(\dot{m}_{\text{coil off}}\) is the air mass flow rate through the heat pump with the cooling coil OFF (kg/s).
- \(h_{\text{out, coil off}}\) is the enthalpy of air exiting the heat pump with the cooling coil OFF (J/kg).
- \(\Delta_{\text{sen, full load}}\) is the sensible load difference at full-load conditions.
- \(\Delta_{\text{sen, coil off}}\) is the sensible load difference with the heating coil OFF conditions.

The part-load ratio for the heat pump is estimated using:

\[ \text{PartLoadRatio} = \max \left( 0.0, \frac{\left|\text{Heat Pump Cooling Load} - \text{No Cool Output}\right|}{\left|\text{Full Cool Output} - \text{No Cool Output}\right|} \right) \]

The final part-load ratio for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations until the heat pump’s cooling output matches the cooling load within a convergence tolerance of 0.001.

For heating operations, if the heat pump is required to supply heating to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, the total sensible heating load is calculated. The heat pump’s sensible heating energy rate is calculated as:

1. **Full Heat Output**: \( \text{Full Heat Output} = (\dot{m}_{\text{full load}})(h_{\text{out, full load}} - h_{\text{control zone}})HR_{\text{min}} - \Delta_{\text{sen, full load}} \)

2. **No Heat Output**: \( \text{No Heat Output} = (\dot{m}_{\text{coil off}})(h_{\text{out, coil off}} - h_{\text{control zone}})HR_{\text{min}} - \Delta_{\text{sen, coil off}} \)

The part-load ratio is similarly estimated as in cooling operations. If the heat pump’s DX heating coil output at full load is insufficient, the remaining heating load is passed to the supplemental heating coil.

High humidity control is available when the supply air fan operates continuously, cycling with the compressor. Various dehumidification control types can be specified, such as MultiMode or CoolReheat, to manage humidity and temperature conditions.

In summary, the heat pump model uses complex calculations to determine sensible and latent capacities, manage air flow rates, and ensure that both heating and cooling loads are met efficiently, while also addressing dehumidification needs.Certainly! Here's a structured and meaningful version of the given text:

---

When the system operates at its lowest speed (Speed 1), the speed ratio is 1.0, and it remains 1.0 when the multispeed heat pump operates at speeds above 1. The speed ratio is defined as the ratio of time in a system time step that the compressor is at rated speed between two consecutive speed numbers. The compressor speed ratio ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 when the speed number is above 1 and is 0.0 during Speed 1 operation.

The speed number is the lowest index number whose corresponding full-load sensible capacity at the given air mass flow rate is greater than or equal to the sensible load (heating or cooling) in a system time step. The heating or cooling capacity delivered by the heat pump is distributed to all of the zones served by this system via the direct air units that supply air to each zone.

The heat pump component is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (fan ON). The fan operation mode is specified using a supply air fan operating mode schedule where schedule values of 0 denote cycling fan operation and values other than 0 denote continuous fan operation. This schedule allows cycling fan operation at night and continuous fan operation during the day.

Several output variables are reported by the heat pump object including fan part-load ratio, compressor part-load ratio, cycling ratio, speed ratio, and speed number. The fan part-load ratio is defined as the actual air mass flow rate through the system for the time step divided by the operating supply air mass flow rate specified for the heat pump at Speed 1, and is set to 1.0 when the heat pump operates at speeds above 1.

If the defrost strategy is reverse cycle for a DX heating coil, the compressor part-load ratio is the sum of the actual load and the defrost load divided by the full-load sensible capacity. This heat pump object also reports the sensible, latent, and total cooling and heating rate, as well as the electricity consumption with separate accounting of auxiliary electric consumption. Additionally, report variables related to waste heat recovery are available if the user chooses to model this option.

The heat pump is a virtual component consisting of a fan, multispeed DX cooling coil, multispeed DX heating coil, and supplemental heating coil. Its sole purpose is to properly coordinate the operation of the various system components.

### Cooling Operation

The description of heat pump cooling operation is divided into two sections: sensible capacity and average supply air flow rate. These calculations are performed in unison.

#### Capacity Calculation

If EnergyPlus determines that the heat pump must supply cooling to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, the heat pump model computes the total sensible cooling load to be delivered based on the control zone sensible cooling load and the fraction of the heat pump air flow that goes through the control zone.

The model calculates the heat pump’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered at full-load conditions at the highest speed and when the DX cooling coil is OFF. If the fan cycles with the compressor, the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However, if the fan runs continuously, the sensible cooling energy rate will not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF.

If the heat pump’s sensible cooling rate at the highest speed is insufficient to meet the entire cooling load, the reported cycling rate and speed ratio are 1, and the speed number is set to the highest index number. If the total sensible cooling load is less than the sensible cooling rate at the highest speed, the sensible cooling energy rate at Speed 1 is calculated.

If the sensible cooling energy rate at Speed 1 is greater than or equal to the sensible load, the cycling ratio for the heat pump is estimated. Final part-load ratios for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations until the heat pump’s cooling output matches the cooling load within a convergence tolerance of 0.001.

#### Air Mass Flow Rate Calculation

If the heat pump has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), the operating supply air mass flow rate is determined by the cycling ratio for Speed 1. If the fan operates continuously, the operating air mass flow rate is calculated as the average of the user-specified air flow rates when the cooling coil is ON and OFF.

### Heating Operation

The description of heat pump heating operation is divided into two sections: total sensible capacity and average supply air flow rate. These calculations are performed in unison.

#### Capacity Calculation

If EnergyPlus determines that the heat pump must supply heating to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, the heat pump model computes the total sensible heating load to be delivered based on the control zone sensible heating load and the fraction of the heat pump air flow that goes through the control zone.

The model calculates the heat pump’s sensible heating energy rate delivered at full-load conditions at the highest speed and when the DX heating coil is OFF. If the heat pump’s DX heating coil output full load at the highest speed is insufficient, the remaining heating load is passed to the supplemental heating coil. If the outdoor air temperature is below the minimum for compressor operation, the compressor is turned off and the entire heating load is passed to the supplemental heating coil.

If the total heating load is less than the sensible heating rate at the highest speed, the sensible heating energy rate at Speed 1 is calculated. If it is greater than or equal to the sensible load, the cycling ratio for the heat pump is estimated.

#### Heat Pump Modeling

The process involves successive modeling of the heating coil and fan until the heat pump's heating output matches the heating load within a convergence tolerance of 0.001. This tolerance is calculated based on the difference between the load to be met and the heat pump's output divided by the load to be met.

- **Tolerance Calculation**: 
  \[
  \text{Tolerance} = \frac{\text{HeatPumpHeatingLoad} - \text{HeatPumpOutput}}{\text{HeatPumpHeatingLoad}} \leq 0.001
  \]

- **Output Cycling**: The heat pump's delivered sensible capacity for Speed 1 operating at a specific cycling ratio is represented by:
  \[
  \text{HeatPumpOutput cycling} = \dot{m}_\text{HeatPump} (h_\text{out} - h_\text{Control Zone}) \cdot HR_\text{min} - \Delta_\text{cycling}
  \]
  where:
  - \(\dot{m}_\text{HeatPump}\) is the average air mass flow rate.
  - \(h_\text{out}\) is the enthalpy of air exiting the heat pump at part load conditions.
  - \(\Delta_\text{cycling}\) is the average sensible load difference between the system output node and the zone inlet node.

In cases where Speed 1 operation meets the required heating load, the speed ratio is set to zero and the speed number is 1. If the heat pump's output at full load for Speed 1 is insufficient to meet the heating load, the Cycling ratio (PartLoadRatio) is set to 1.0, and the heating speed is increased.

- **Speed Ratio Estimation**: 
  \[
  \text{Speed Ratio} = \frac{\left|\text{Heat Pump Heating Load} - \text{AddedFanHeat} - \text{Full Heat Output Speed}_{n-1}\right|}{\left|\text{Full Heat Output Speed}_n - \text{Full Heat Output Speed}_{n-1}\right|}
  \]

The outlet node conditions depend on combined outputs, and the supply air fan heat varies based on heating coil operation. The final speed ratio for the heating coil compressor and fan is determined through iterative calculations.

#### Air Mass Flow Rate and Fan Placement

The air mass flow rate calculations during heating are the same as for cooling. Fan placement impacts the iteration strategy:

- **Blow-Through Fan Placement**: The fan is upstream of the coil components, which affects fan outlet conditions. The fan outlet conditions are calculated without knowing the next component's performance at the beginning of each iteration.

- **Draw-Through Fan Placement**: The supply air fan is downstream of the DX coils, eliminating the need for extra calls to heat pump components.

#### Waste Heat Calculation

When heat recovery is active, the outlet node temperature of heat recovery is calculated based on recoverable waste heat:
\[
T_\text{outlet} = T_\text{inlet} + \frac{Q_\text{WasteHeat}}{C_p \dot{m}_\text{hr}}
\]
where:
- \(T_\text{outlet}\) and \(T_\text{inlet}\) are the outlet and inlet node temperatures, respectively.
- \(Q_\text{WasteHeat}\) is the recoverable waste heat.
- \(C_p\) is the specific heat capacity.
- \(\dot{m}_\text{hr}\) is the mass flow rate of heat recovery.

#### DX Cooling Package

The DX cooling package subsystem model consists of a DX air cooling coil component. It operates continuously and does not control cycling fan operation as other systems do. Controls calculate the current sensible load using the inlet node temperature and the desired outlet node temperature is adjusted for the current temperature difference.

#### DX Heating Package

The DX heating package subsystem model consists of a DX air-to-air heating coil component. It calculates how the coil should operate to meet the current sensible load using the temperature of the inlet node and the outlet node setpoint.

#### Desiccant Dehumidifier Package

The desiccant dehumidifier subsystem dehumidifies an air stream using a desiccant heat exchanger. The input object coordinates the operation of objects like a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater.

The model first decides if the dehumidifier can operate based on its availability schedule and the air flow detected. Components upstream of the desiccant heat exchanger's regeneration inlet are modeled depending on the configuration. If the waste heat from a companion cooling coil is used, then the regeneration air fan and heater operate to achieve the specified inlet air setpoint temperature.

The water removal rate and removed water are calculated after modeling the desiccant dehumidifier components.

The performance of a DX cooling coil is influenced by the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier for a coil can be represented by:

\[ \text{CAPFT coil, cooling} = a + b(T_{wb,i}) + c(T_{wb,i})^2 + d(T_{wb,i})^3 \]

or 

\[ \text{CAPFT coil, cooling} = a + b(T_{wb,i}) + c(T_{wb,i})^2 + d(T_c) + e(T_c)^2 + f(T_{wb,i}) (T_c) \]

where:
- \( T_{wb,i} \) is the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil in zone \( i \) (°C).
- \( T_{wb,avg} \) is the load-weighted average wet-bulb temperature of the air entering all operating cooling coils (°C).
- \( \dot{Q}_{zone (i)} \) is the total cooling load in zone \( i \) (W).
- \( \dot{Q}_{zone, total} \) is the total cooling load in all zones (W).
- \( T_c \) is the temperature of the air entering a condenser (°C).
- \( a-f \) are coefficients for the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier.

#### Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Using Multiple Curves

The cooling capacity ratio modifier adjusts the heat pump's rated cooling capacity to account for variations in operating conditions. In some cases, two cooling capacity ratio modifier curves are used to capture performance at different outdoor temperatures. A boundary curve is used to define the separation between these curves.

- For water-cooled condensers, only the low temperature curve is used.
- Boundary and high temperature performance curves are not needed if a single performance curve suffices.

- Boundary and high temperature performance curves improve representation when performance changes abruptly.
- The boundary curve is defined by outdoor temperature as a function of average indoor wet-bulb temperature.

#### Cooling Coil Sensible Capacity Determination

The cooling coil's sensible capacity is determined iteratively to match the zone's sensible cooling load. The iteration resolves when the difference between the zone's sensible cooling load and the terminal unit's sensible cooling capacity is within a defined tolerance.

#### Cooling Piping Correction Factor

This factor accounts for piping losses in the refrigeration system. It is calculated using equivalent piping length and combination ratio, with adjustments made for vertical height differences.

#### Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Modifier

In heat recovery mode, available cooling capacity differs from that in cooling-only mode. A modifier adjusts the available cooling capacity using a fraction based on indoor and outdoor temperatures. If data is limited, a constant term may be used.

#### Transition from Cooling Only to Heat Recovery Mode

The transition involves a change in available cooling capacity, modeled with an exponential decay curve. This curve accounts for time needed to reach steady-state capacity.

Inputs include design values for primary and secondary air flow rates, inlet and outlet temperatures, and flow configuration (counter, parallel, or crossflow). The heat exchanger's total UA is variable with the primary and secondary mass flow rates and inlet temperatures.

#### Model Description
Design inlet and outlet conditions help determine design effectiveness. The UA is calculated using the formula:
\[ UA = UAdes \times \frac{(rhA + 1)}{((\dot{m}_p,des \cdot T_{p,des} / \dot{m}_p \cdot T_p)^{0.78} + rhA \cdot (\dot{m}_s,des \cdot T_{s,des} / \dot{m}_s \cdot T_s)^{0.78})} \]

If any condition is false, heat exchange is suspended. Otherwise, it calculates process and regeneration outlet air conditions and electric power.

The model calculates sensible, latent, and total heat transfer rates using:
- Sensible: \( \dot{Q}_{Sensible} = \dot{m}_{Proc} \cdot C_{p,Proc,in} \cdot (T_{Proc,out} - T_{Proc,in}) \)
- Total: \( \dot{Q}_{Total} = \dot{m}_{Proc} \cdot (h_{Proc,out} - h_{Proc,in}) \)

### Air System Humidifiers Overview

Air system humidifiers add moisture to the supply air stream and are categorized into spray type humidifiers, which cool and humidify the air, and dry steam humidifiers, which humidify without significant temperature change. The EnergyPlus models for electric and gas-fired steam humidifiers use electrical and thermal energy to convert water to steam, which is then injected into the air stream.

The model is a forward model with inputs being inlet conditions and outputs being outlet conditions and energy consumption. The moisture mass balance and psychometric calculations are similar for both gas and electric humidifiers. The difference lies in the heat source used for steam generation.

##### Controller

The controller determines whether the humidifier is on or off. Conditions for activation include a nonzero schedule value, greater than zero inlet air mass flow, and an inlet air humidity ratio less than the minimum setpoint. If inactive, the water addition rate is zero; if active, the rate needed to meet the humidity setpoint is calculated using the moisture balance equation.

##### Component

Inputs to the component model include air inlet conditions, mass flow rate, and the water addition rate from the controller. If the desired water addition rate exceeds component capacity, adjustments are made. The component power consumption is set to standby power when scheduled on, otherwise set to zero. Moisture and enthalpy balance equations are used to calculate outlet conditions.

**17.3 Pipes**

**17.3.1 Heat Transfer in Pipes**

Heat loss and time delay in plant loop pipes (Indoor and Outdoor) can be modeled by selecting the environment for heat transfer: ‘OutdoorAir’, ‘Zone’, or ‘Schedule’. The simulation uses a discretized model with control volumes around nodes representing fluid, pipe wall, and environment. The heat balance equations are solved iteratively to model the temperature changes in the pipes.

**17.3.2 Underground Pipe Model**

The buried pipe model includes boundary conditions for symmetric vertical boundaries, ground surface, 'far-field', and 'deep ground'. The model accounts for soil thickness and properties, using input data for accurate simulation.

**17.3.3 Piping System: Underground Simulation**

A generalized model allows the simulation of underground piping systems in a solid medium. The dual-coordinate system focuses computational effort near the pipes, using a coarse Cartesian system for the conducting region and a refined radial system near the pipes. The model can simulate diverse applications with flexibility in input parameters.**Structured Text:**

**Adiabatic Boundary Condition**

In certain applications, an adiabatic boundary condition is applied to specific surfaces within the domain. For scenarios involving a basement or an under-slab region, the adiabatic boundary is used to represent the vertical line of symmetry.

**Pipe Cell Simulation**

The ground is divided into coarse Cartesian cells, some containing pipes. These "pipe-cells" are further divided into a radial system with a specialized interface cell to couple these systems. The radial cells consist of ground cells, an optional insulation cell, the pipe cell, and the fluid itself. The fluid is modeled as a cylindrical cell interacting with incoming fluid and heat transfer to the pipe. When there is no flow, the cell becomes radially adiabatic, allowing the fluid temperature to vary during off periods. When there is flow, the incoming fluid and heat transfer balance with the mass of the cell to determine a new fluid temperature to be passed downstream. The fluid within the cells is modeled directionally, allowing flow through multiple pipe segments in different directions. The flow direction in each pipe is specified by an input choice field.

**Basement Interaction**

The model interacts with basement surfaces, split into floor and wall surfaces. All walls are treated as an average wall surface, and all floors are treated as an average floor surface. The domain is adjusted based on the basement's width and height. The ground heat transfer model does not simulate transient conditions of the basement surfaces, leaving these to surface heat balance algorithms. The model instead uses an OtherSideConditions model to interact at the outer boundary, applying a constant surface temperature boundary condition with a high convection coefficient once convergence is achieved.

**Mesh Development**

The mesh is developed using simple parameters, divided into a Cartesian mesh and a near-pipe refined radial mesh. The Cartesian mesh uses a cell density parameter to define the number of cells in the simulation, applied to all domain regions. The radial coordinate system is uniform for soil cells, specified by cell count and radial mesh thickness.

**Simulation Methodology**

The simulation is performed in two parts: the ground simulation and the pipe cell simulation. The ground is simulated once per system time step, simulating all cells without a pipe segment. The boundary conditions include current surface conditions, far-field model, and previous pipe cell temperatures. This decoupling focuses computational effort near the pipes.

**Pumps**

Pumps drive the flow in plant and condenser loops, reacting based on conditions such as speed (constant or variable) and operation (continuous or intermittent). Pumps are simulated first on the supply side loop after the demand side loop determines the demand. 

- Pumps can be on the supply or demand side of the plant loop.
- A pump on the demand side must be the first component of the inlet branch.
- Pumps in the condenser loop must be on the supply side.
- Pumps can operate as constant or variable flow.
- Pumps can run continuously or intermittently.

A single boiler/chiller with no bypass uses a constant or variable speed pump depending on flow requirements. Multiple branches require continuity and may benefit from a bypass for safety. 

**Dynamic Pump Pressure Head**

Plant/condenser loop simulations can account for dynamic loop pressure drop. The loop pressure drop is calculated based on each branch's pressure drop data, setting this as the pump pressure head. 

**Variable Speed Pump**

A variable speed pump operates between maximum and minimum flow rates, trying to meet flow requests from demand side components. The fraction of full load power is determined by a cubic equation, modifying nominal power use. 

**Pressure-based Flow for Variable Speed Pumps**

Variable speed pumps can model realistic operation with differential pressure control or manual control. Differential pressure control maintains pressure within a range, checking flow rates against maximum and minimum rotational speeds.

**Constant Speed Pump**

A constant speed pump runs at a designated maximum flow rate. The fraction of full load power is always 1, making the power always full power.

**Pressure-based Flow for Constant Speed Pumps**

Constant speed pumps can dynamically respond to plant loop pressure drop, using a pump curve to determine flow rate.

**Pump Heat Addition**

Pumps increase fluid temperature due to friction, adding heat to the fluid. Heat is calculated using shaft power and motor efficiency, added to the plant loop interface.

**Headered Pumps**

Headered pumps consist of multiple pumps connected in parallel, simulated as a single component. The flow rate is determined by the number of operating pumps and individual pump flow rate.To generate a structured and meaningful text, unnecessary references, directories, and non-essential sentences have been removed while retaining the core information. Here's a more concise version:

The text describes conduction transfer functions (CTFs) used in building element simulations to model heat transfer through surfaces. CTFs provide a method to calculate heat flux at the interior surface of building elements, assuming one-dimensional conduction heat transfer. The heat flux is linearly related to current and previous temperatures at both surfaces and previous flux values. The methods to calculate CTFs are the Laplace Transform method and the State Space method. 

The Laplace Transform method involves converting one-dimensional heat conduction equations into the s-domain, forming a transmission matrix that contains thermophysical properties of the layer. It is particularly useful for multilayered slabs. The State Space method uses linear matrix equations to relate inputs and outputs, allowing the modeling of transient heat conduction by enforcing a finite difference grid over layers. 

Both methods can be extended to include heat sources or sinks, and the State Space method is adaptable to two-dimensional models, especially useful in hydronic radiant systems where water tubes are present. The two-dimensional approach enhances simulation accuracy by expanding the node network perpendicular to heat transfer direction, maintaining isothermal boundary conditions. 

In summary, the text discusses advanced methods for simulating heat transfer in building elements, emphasizing the calculation of conduction transfer functions and their applications in both one and two-dimensional models.The thermal-physical properties of the material in a layer maintain solution stability, with the number of nodes in the perpendicular direction fixed for all construction layers. In EnergyPlus, this number is set at 7, balancing accuracy with solution speed. Increasing nodes excessively slows the calculation of conduction transfer functions. The heat source or sink applies evenly over the entire node, defined by the ConstructionProperty:InternalHeatSource input. The model assumes the entire layer consists of the material defined by the Construction:InternalSource input, ignoring tubing and fluid. The radiant model considers heat transfer between the material and fluid in the system.

The location of the heat source and an additional control point are defined by input in the ConstructionPropery:InternalHeatSource input. The location of tubing for heat addition or subtraction is always on one side of the solution domain. The user controls the additional temperature request location via specified fields, which can then control a radiant system. These assumptions apply to low-temperature radiant systems within EnergyPlus, as shown in diagrams. The symmetry of a low-temperature radiant system and corresponding solution domain are illustrated.

The number of nodes for heat transfer in each layer is calculated like a standard layer with 1-D heat conduction. EnergyPlus sets the node number in the perpendicular direction to 7 for balance. Determining internal temperatures in low-temperature radiant systems involves specifying the effect on slab response via a heat source term. For hydronic systems, the known quantity is the fluid temperature, not heat. When fluid circulation ceases, no temperature value is available as an input.

A hydronic system relates slab heat delivery to the inlet fluid temperature, treating the slab as a heat exchanger. With known inlet fluid temperature, system geometry, and solid temperature, heat transfer to the building element can be computed. The solid temperature is defined as the building element's temperature at the hydronic loop depth, typically unknown. For hydronic systems, extracting this information is necessary to solve for the heat source term.

The final solution for a slab with a source at the interface between two layers is expressed mathematically, accounting for previous temperature and flux histories. An internal temperature is extracted using a rearranged CTF equation, applicable regardless of whether the Laplace transform or state space method is used. The state space method defines an internal temperature as an additional output variable.

For low-temperature radiant system controls, the system integrates fully into the heat balance, automatically participating in radiation balances and thermal comfort models. Once transient nature is addressed, controls become the next challenge. EnergyPlus offers variable flow and constant flow/variable temperature control schemes, handled as separate system types.

Variable flow radiant systems use schedules to define a setpoint temperature and throttling range, varying the flow rate from zero to a maximum. The controlling temperature can be set to various options, and operative temperature is the average of MAT and MRT. Inside face temperature can also be controlled, defined by slab construction input.

Users performing a two-dimensional solution can define the user-requested temperature location perpendicular to the main heat transfer direction. This flexibility allows defining a point for radiant system control. Constant flow/variable temperature systems involve user-defined control and water temperature schedules, offering operational flexibility.

The constant flow model combines mixing valves, a pump, and the radiant system, connected to the main loop. System controls determine inlet temperature and flow rate. Loop controls manage loop flow rate and temperature. Four conditions dictate system performance based on loop temperature and flow adequacy.

Integrating the low-temperature radiant system model with a building simulation program presents challenges. Most programs simulate building envelopes, space conditioning systems, and central plant equipment separately. IBLAST, a predecessor to EnergyPlus, integrated these components, allowing feedback between equipment and building envelope. Systems sometimes simulate at shorter time steps for stability, presenting problems for a radiant system. EnergyPlus uses a multi-step approach, simulating heat balance first with the radiant system off, then allowing radiant operation per user controls.The given text describes the simulation of radiant systems in EnergyPlus, focusing on the heat exchange process between the hydronic system and building elements. The simulation process involves several steps:

1. **Time Step Simulation**: The simulation assumes a constant flow rate over each zone time step. When the heat source/sink in the radiant system varies, the zone heat balance must be recalculated to understand the zone's response to these changes. Although this isn't physically accurate, it's necessary to balance computational feasibility and simulation stability.

2. **Heat Exchanger Formulation**: The heat transferred between the building element and the hydronic loop is based on the inlet water temperature and mass flow rate. EnergyPlus uses the effectiveness-NTU method to model this exchange, assuming the building element is stationary and the water flows at a constant rate.

3. **Heat Balance Equations**: The system's heat balance involves calculating energy transfer between the water loop and building elements. The effectiveness of the heat exchanger is determined by comparing actual and maximum possible energy transfers. The NTU (Number of Transfer Units) is calculated using the UA (overall heat transfer coefficient) and heat transfer equations.

4. **Model Assumptions**: Several assumptions are made, such as constant temperature along the tubing length and water being the fluid. The model includes two methods for heat exchange: ConvectionOnly and ISOStandard, each with specific assumptions and equations.

5. **Simulation Equations**: The text outlines complex equations relating heat source, water temperatures, and surface temperatures. These equations integrate heat balance terms and require solving for unknowns without iteration to ensure computational efficiency.

6. **Temperature Calculations**: The simulation includes detailed calculations for inside and outside surface temperatures using conduction transfer functions. These involve accounting for various heat exchange factors at the surface and source/sink locations.

7. **Radiant System Complexity**: The radiant system's complexity requires precise mathematical formulations to handle heat source/sink dynamics, ensuring accurate simulation results without iterative processes.

Overall, the text provides an in-depth explanation of the mathematical modeling and simulation procedures for radiant systems in EnergyPlus, emphasizing the need for precise calculations and assumptions to achieve accurate energy simulations.The text discusses two models related to HVAC systems: the High Temperature Radiant Heater Model and the Simple Cooling Panel Model.

### High Temperature Radiant Heater Model:
This model, offered by the `ZoneHVAC:HighTemperatureRadiant` input object in EnergyPlus, provides a flexible representation of high-temperature radiant heaters (both gas-fired and electric). These heaters, often resembling lamps or tubes, are typically suspended from the ceiling and designed to heat occupants within a zone via direct radiation. Users can specify the percentage of heat that radiates from the heater and onto specific surfaces. Additionally, the model allows for defining what fraction of radiation affects a person directly for thermal comfort considerations. This heat contribution is integrated into thermal comfort models, such as those by Fanger, Pierce, and KSU Two-Node.

Key parameters include:
- Maximum power input
- Heater type (gas or electric)
- Combustion efficiency (for gas heaters)
- Fractions of radiant, latent, and lost heat
- Temperature control type and heating throttling range
- Distribution of radiant energy across surfaces and to people

The model assumes that the fractions of radiant, convective, latent, and lost heat sum to unity, with convective energy being the remainder. Radiant energy is distributed to people and surfaces, ensuring that the sum of these distribution fractions also equals unity. The model accounts for the thermal comfort impact of radiant energy on people separately from the zone air and surface heat balances.

### Simple Cooling Panel Model:
The `ZoneHVAC:CoolingPanel:RadiantConvective:Water` input object represents a simple chilled ceiling model, designed to simplify radiant system modeling. Unlike the active chilled beam systems, this model is not solely convective and can be used for passive systems as well. Assumptions include:
- Water flows through pipes with a known inlet temperature.
- The outlet water temperature is calculated during simulation.
- Air conditions are assumed constant for each time step.
- The system is a heat exchanger, with water changing temperature while air remains constant.

The model employs an effectiveness-NTU heat exchanger formulation to calculate total heat gain to the panel and the outlet water temperature. The net heat loss to the zone considers convective load, radiant gain to people, and increased convection loss from surfaces. Controls include water flow rate management to meet thermostatic setpoint temperatures, with options for various temperature control types. Condensation control measures are also included.

The model calculates the UA value using panel rating data, which includes parameters like rating inlet water temperature, air/surroundings temperature, water mass flow rate, and rated output capacity. The radiant panel output is determined using the mean air temperature (MAT) and mean radiant temperature (MRT) to create a "zone" temperature for calculations. The fraction radiant parameter defines how the zone temperature is computed, influencing the radiant cooling panel's performance estimation.

Overall, these models provide detailed frameworks for simulating radiant heating and cooling systems within EnergyPlus, allowing for comprehensive thermal comfort and energy balance analyses.The text describes the EnergyPlus software's capabilities in modeling refrigeration systems, specifically focusing on supermarket refrigeration equipment. It discusses the modeling of refrigerated case equipment, including compressor racks, refrigerated cases, and walk-in coolers. The equipment models perform several functions, such as calculating electric consumption, determining cooling and dehumidification loads, and calculating the heat rejected by the compressor rack's condenser.

Key points include:

1. **Refrigeration Equipment Overview:**

6. **Heat Reclaim and Zone Heating:**
   - The system can reclaim waste heat for air or water heating, enhancing energy efficiency.
   - Condenser heat can be rejected to zones, affecting the zone air heat balance.

7. **Water Cooled Condensers:**
   - Water-cooled condensers require plant loops with components like pumps and cooling towers.
   - The system dynamically adjusts to meet temperature setpoints while managing flow rates and heat loads.

Overall, the text provides a technical overview of the capabilities and functions of the EnergyPlus software in modeling refrigeration systems within buildings, focusing on energy efficiency and load management.Here's a more structured and meaningful version of the provided text:

---

**Refrigerant Expansion Valve Operation**

- Refrigerant expansion valve operation can be impaired by pressure changes.
- Ambient conditions producing low-temperature warnings may require an outlet temperature setpoint control on the water heat sink object (e.g., cooling tower) to maintain return water temperature above the minimum level.
- For constant water loop flow driven by a constant speed pump, the outlet water temperature will vary with the heat rejected by the condenser.

**Evaporative Condenser Water Pump**

- An evaporative condenser requires a water pump to circulate water.
- Pump power is either input directly or calculated using a specific formula based on the rated total cooling capacity.
- The water pump runs continuously, except when evaporative cooling is unavailable (e.g., to prevent freezing), resulting in zero pump power consumption during such periods.

**Evaporative Condenser Water Consumption**

- Makeup water is needed to replace water lost due to evaporation.
- The quantity required is calculated based on air mass flow rate and humidity differences.
- Air mass flow rate is determined by the evaporative condenser's air volume flow rate and air density.

**Evaporative Condenser Basin Heater**

- In cold climates, a basin heater prevents freezing of the evaporative cooling water.
- The heater operates when the outdoor air is below a specified temperature and the system is idle.
- Power demand is calculated based on temperature differences.

**Evaporative Condenser Availability Schedule**

- Some systems allow seasonal draining and air-cooled operation during cold months to prevent ice formation.
- When evaporative cooling is unavailable, the system operates as air-cooled without water consumption or pump/basin heater loads.

**Refrigerated Cases**

- Refrigerated cases work with compressor racks to simulate performance.
- The model accounts for sensible and latent heat exchange, impacting the surrounding environment.
- Total load on the evaporator consists of multiple components, including heat transfer, lighting, and restocking.

**Case Evaporator Fan**

- Fan electric power is calculated based on operating power, case length, and defrost schedule.
- All fan power contributes directly to the case evaporator's heat load.

**Case Lighting**

- Lighting power is calculated based on installed power, schedule value, and case length.
- A portion of lighting energy contributes to the case evaporator's heat load.

**Anti-Sweat Heater Performance**

- Anti-sweat heaters prevent moisture condensation using various control strategies.
- Power use varies with ambient conditions like humidity or dewpoint temperature.
- All control methods allow specifying the fraction of energy contributing to the case evaporator heat load.

**Case Restocking**

- Restocking heat load is modeled with a schedule and calculated based on case length.
- Unmet restocking load is carried over to subsequent time steps if the evaporator capacity is insufficient.

**Case Defrost**

- Eight defrost strategies are available, including none, off-cycle, electric, hot-gas, and hot-brine with variations.

This structured summary retains all meaningful content from the original text, focusing on important aspects of refrigeration equipment operation and maintenance.Defrost times for cases defrosted using hot brine can be significantly shorter than those for electric or hot gas. For each of these strategies, the refrigerated case evaporator is turned off for the required time period to allow accumulated frost to melt. Additional time can be scheduled (drip-down) to allow water to drip from the evaporator and drain from the case. Refrigerated cases typically require a specific number of defrost cycles per day for a predetermined length of time. Refer to manufacturer’s recommendations for proper defrost frequency and duration. For example, a refrigerated case may have a single defrost period each day, scheduled from 7:00 – 7:40 am with defrost drip-down scheduled from 7:00 – 7:55 am. Notice the drip-down schedule and the defrost schedule start at the same time, and the drip-down schedule is longer than the defrost schedule. These schedules should normally repeat for each day of the year.

For electric, hot gas, and hot brine defrost types, energy use by the defrost heater occurs during the scheduled defrost period. For defrost with temperature termination, the energy is also multiplied by the defrost ratio simulating a defrost duration shorter than the defined (maximum) period. For all non-electric defrost types, defrost electric power is set equal to zero. For hot gas and hot brine defrost types in cases served by a detailed system, the condenser heat rejection load is reduced by the amount of heat recovered for use in the defrost system. This condenser credit is not applied for the simple compressor rack system.

Frost accumulation on the case evaporator will vary with the humidity level in the ambient air surrounding the case. Therefore, defrost heater operation can be reduced when ambient air humidity levels are low. Several methods are used to reduce unnecessary defrost heater operation, including terminating heater operation when the measured evaporator temperature indicates that the accumulated frost has been completely melted. For modeling refrigerated cases with temperature-terminated defrost, EnergyPlus allows the user to specify a defrost energy correction curve to account for variations in defrost energy as ambient air humidity levels change. The user can select from four correction curve types: None, Case Temperature Method, Relative Humidity Method, or Dewpoint Method.

Sensible case credits are calculated to account for variations at off-rated ambient air temperatures. The model also allows the user to define a case credit fraction using a schedule object. This case credit fraction can be useful for modeling cases that operate differently during specific time periods. For example, metal or plastic coverings may be installed on refrigerated display cases during unoccupied hours, which would significantly reduce case credits compared to occupied hours when the coverings are removed.

Refrigerated cases also remove latent energy (moisture) from the surrounding environment, termed “latent case credits.” The latent case credits are calculated as the product of the case length, total cooling capacity per unit length, latent heat ratio, and runtime fraction at rated conditions. A case credit fraction schedule is used to model cases that operate differently during specific time periods. The same case credit fraction is used to modify both the sensible and latent case credits. The calculation of latent case credits also includes a factor that accounts for lower ambient humidity levels. Latent case credits are set to zero during the defrost-dripdown periods.

For certain refrigerated case types, the sensible case credits provided to the zone can create an uncomfortably cold environment in the surrounding area. Return air ducts are frequently placed behind these cases to draw this cold air under the case and direct it back to the HVAC system. This reduces localized over-cooling and improves occupant comfort.

Variable evaporator temperature control systems are now available that increase the evaporator temperature to improve compressor efficiency whenever the total loads on a system are less than the system capacity. To model these systems, a variable evaporator temperature is an option available with the detailed refrigeration system object.

Walk-in coolers and freezers differ from refrigerated cases in that they may have surfaces facing more than one zone and are always equipped with doors. Their sensible and latent exchange with zones is calculated differently than for refrigerated cases. The walk-in cooler performance is based on models that include infiltration through door openings and sensible loss through walls/ceilings described by the user for each zone. All equipment loads (fan, light, heaters) are modeled as well. Sensible and latent exchange with multiple adjoining zones is included. A master schedule is used for the Walk-In operation, and additional schedules control the lights, defrost, and heater operation.Infiltration through doorways places both a sensible and a latent load upon the walk-in, and corresponding credits upon the adjacent zone. Two types of doors, 'stock' and 'glass', can be modeled to account for differences in thermal conductance, door protection type, and frequency of opening. The sensible and latent infiltration loads are modeled according to ASHRAE guidelines. The air within the cooler is assumed to be at 90% relative humidity. Equal air exchange is assumed, meaning the mass of dry air infiltrating into the walk-in equals the mass of dry air infiltrating out.

Key equations include:

- QInfiltration = QFullFlow · Factor DoorOpen · Factor Flow · (1−Factor Protection)
- QFullFlow = 0.221 ∗ ADoor (hZoneAir − hAirWalkIn) ρAirWalkIn (1−ρZoneAir / ρAirWalkIn)^0.5 (g ∗ HDoor)^0.5 Factor Density
- Factor Density = (2 / (1 + (ρAirWalkIn / ρZoneAir)^0.333))^1.5
- mDryAir = QInfiltration / (hZoneAir − hAirWalkIn)
- mWater = mDryAir · (WZoneAir − WAirWalkIn)
- QWalkInLatentZn = mWater · ∆hIceToVapor · (1−SCH Defrost,DripDown)
- QWalkInSensInfZn = QInfiltration − (mWater · ∆hIceToVapor)

Where:

- ADoor is the area of the door facing Zone n (m²)
- Factor DoorOpen is the scheduled fraction of time the door is open during a time step
- Factor Flow is the doorway flow factor, set at 0.8 if ∆TZn ≥ 11°C; 1.1 if ∆TZn < 11°C
- Factor Protection is the doorway protection factor, ranging from 0 to 0.9
- g is the gravitational constant
- hAirWalkIn is the enthalpy of the air within the walk-in
- hZoneAir is the enthalpy of the air in Zone n
- HDoor is the height of the door facing Zone n
- QFullFlow represents the sensible and latent refrigeration load for fully established flow (W)
- QInfiltration is the average infiltration refrigeration load for the time step (W)
- QWalkInLatentZn represents the latent load on the walk-in facing Zone n (W)
- QWalkInSensInfZn is the sensible load due to infiltration upon the walk-in facing Zone n (W)
- mDryAir is the mass of dry air infiltrating into the walk-in (kg/s)
- mWater is the mass of water removed from the infiltrating air (kg/s)
- WAirWalkIn is the humidity ratio of the air within the walk-in
- WZoneAir is the humidity ratio of Zone n air
- ∆hIceToVapor is the latent heat absorbed to change ice to vapor (J/kg)
- ρAirWalkIn is the density of the air within the walk-in
- ρZoneAir is the density of air in Zone n

The sensible load on the case and the sensible credit to the zone continue throughout the defrost and dripdown periods. There is no latent credit to the zone or latent load upon the cooler during the dripdown period. The sensible heat exchange between the walk-in and the zone is then the total of the heat transfer through the doors, surfaces, and the infiltration sensible load. The latent load upon the walk-in is converted to the amount of frost added to the coils during each time step, which is later used to determine the load placed upon the walk-in during the defrost cycle.

The total load on the walk-in is calculated as follows:

- QWalkInLatentTot = Σ QWalkInLatentZn
- QWalkInSensTot = Σ QWalkInSensZn + QLight + QFan + QHeater + QDefrost + QStocking + QFloor
- QWalkInTotal = QWalkInLatentTot + QWalkInSensTot
- ∆Frost Tot = Σ ∆Frost Zn

Walk-in fans, heaters, lighting, and restocking contribute to the sensible heat loads on a walk-in. Larger walk-ins have separate fans for the cooling coil and general circulation. The cooling coil fan is assumed to be off for Hot-Fluid and Electric defrost. Lighting, heating, and restocking are modeled according to schedule values entered by the user.

Defrost types available for the walk-in model include none, off-cycle, electric, and hot-fluid. Defrosts can be scheduled or ended by temperature termination. Dripdown schedules keep the cooling coil off long enough to drain condensate from the system. For off-cycle defrost, the walk-in refrigeration capacity is set to zero during the drip-down period. The energy used by electric defrost is available as an output variable.

Air chillers and air chiller sets can be used in refrigerated warehouses. The refrigeration load in these zones is calculated using the EnergyPlus zone heat balance. The air chiller performance is based on manufacturer ratings, Unit Load Factor, Total Capacity Map, or European standards. Correction factors for material and refrigerant are applied to all ratings.

For detailed refrigeration systems, performance data for each compressor is required, along with condenser performance curves. The model provides optional suction piping heat gain comparison, allows load transfer between systems, and does not assume sufficient compressor and condenser capacity to meet case loads, carrying unmet load over to the next time step.Here's the structured and meaningful text generated from the given unstructured text:

---

### Refrigeration System Performance

**Energy Transfer and Load Calculations**

Refrigeration systems involve complex energy transfer processes. The system performance is influenced by condensing and evaporating temperatures. The user can optionally include suction pipe heat gain in the load calculation, which is usually small compared to other loads but can differ significantly when comparing DX systems to secondary systems.

**Compressor Energy Use**

Compressor performance depends on inlet (suction) and outlet (discharge) conditions. The saturated suction temperature minus the pressure drop in the suction pipes defines the suction pressure, typically resulting in a 1°C temperature drop. The discharge pressure is similarly defined, with a typical 0.5°C increase. Manufacturer’s performance curves, as per ARI Standard 540, are used for calculations.

**Two-Stage Compression Systems**

Two-stage compression systems are beneficial for low-temperature applications with high-pressure ratios. An intercooler cools the discharge gas between stages, reducing power requirements. The optimum intermediate pressure minimizes total system power consumption and is typically the geometric mean of evaporator and condenser pressures.

**Condenser Performance**

A single condenser per system can handle multiple refrigeration systems’ heat rejection. Condensers can be modeled with various cooling methods, such as dry air, evaporative, water loop, or cascade cooling. Condenser performance determines the condensing temperature and influences compressor efficiency, fan and pump power, and water consumption.

**Air-Cooled Condensers**

The performance of air-cooled condensers is proportional to the temperature difference between the condensing temperature and the dry-bulb temperature. Manufacturer data typically shows a linear relationship, with corrections for air density variations due to elevation.

**Condenser Fan Energy Use**

Condenser fan power varies by control type: fixed, variable speed, or two-speed. Power is adjusted to maintain minimum condensing temperatures, with different control methods determining the relationship between air volume and power consumption.

**Evaporative-Cooled Condensers**

Evaporative cooling uses the wet-bulb temperature for more efficient heat rejection than dry air cooling, potentially improving system efficiency by up to 10%. Elevation corrections adjust for air density variations.

This structured text captures the meaningful content from the original passage, focusing on refrigeration system processes, calculations, and performance considerations without unnecessary references or extraneous information.Certainly! Here's a meaningful and structured version of the text, focusing on refrigeration equipment and related calculations:

---

### Refrigeration Equipment

**Correction for Barometric Pressure:**
The correction for barometric pressure as a function of elevation is based on a standard correlation. The corrected heat rejection is calculated using:

\[ H_{\text{rej Rated, Corrected}} = H_{\text{rej Rated}} \times \left(1 - 3.07 \times 10^{-5} \times \text{Elevation} \right) \]

**Condensing Temperature Calculation:**
To calculate the condensing temperature for an evaporative cooled condenser, manufacturers provide performance data. This data is expressed as a function of entering wet-bulb temperature and the heat rejection ratio, represented by:

\[ T_{\text{condense}} = C_1 + C_2 \times \text{HRCF} + C_3 \times \text{HRCF} + (1 + C_4) \times T_{\text{wetbulb}} \]

Coefficients \( C_1, C_2, C_3, \) and \( C_4 \) are determined through regression from manufacturer data.

**Evaporative Condensers:**
The water consumption for an evaporative condenser is based on air flow rate, total heat rejection, and the environment. Water use includes evaporation and purge water, calculated at a rate of 5.0E-10 m³/s per Watt of heat rejection.

**Air Flow and Heat Rejection:**
The air flow through the condenser is controlled to maintain a minimum condensing temperature. The rated capacity is recalculated based on reduced air flow and specified minimum temperature.

\[ \text{Reduced Rated Heat Rejection} = \text{HRCF} \times H_{\text{rej}} \]

**Water-Cooled Condensers:**
For water-cooled condensers, the condensing temperature is set equal to the inlet water temperature plus an approach temperature difference.

**Cascade Condensers:**
Cascade condensers connect two refrigeration systems. The primary system absorbs heat rejected by the secondary system. The control type determines if the condensing temperature is fixed or allowed to float.

**Subcoolers:**
Subcoolers reduce refrigerant temperature post-condenser. Two types exist: mechanical and liquid suction subcoolers. Mechanical subcoolers transfer load between systems, while liquid suction subcoolers use cold gas to subcool the liquid refrigerant.

**Suction Piping Heat Gains:**
Suction piping heat gain, although smaller, is considered in load calculations. It requires calculating the U-value and surface area of the piping.

**Secondary Refrigeration Systems:**
These systems use a secondary loop with a circulating pump and heat exchanger. The secondary evaporator chills a brine or glycol solution, which in turn chills the loads. The loop's performance is based on the heat exchanger's effectiveness, refrigeration load, and pump power.

This structured text retains the meaningful content, focusing on the key components and calculations related to refrigeration equipment.The text describes the operation and components of refrigeration systems, specifically focusing on liquid CO2 overfeed systems and transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycles. Below is the structured and meaningful version of the text:

---

**Liquid CO2 Overfeed Systems:**

The liquid CO2 is extracted from the bottom of the separator/receiver and pumped to the load. The 'liquid overfeed ratio' is the ratio of the total pumped mass flow rate of CO2 to the mass rate of CO2 evaporated at the load. With variable flow rates, the liquid overfeed ratio is maintained at or above a specified value. With constant flow rates, the ratio varies to match the capacity of the variable refrigeration load. Despite circulating more CO2 than is evaporated, the pumping power requirements are less than for single-phase secondary coolants.

**Secondary Evaporators in Single-Phase and Two-Phase Loops:**

For single-phase systems, the heat exchanger effectiveness is calculated based on input rating data, including temperature differences and heat exchanger capacity. For two-phase systems, both evaporating and condensing sides of the heat exchanger operate at fixed temperatures. The capacity is calculated as the sum of rated loads plus pump power.

**Secondary Loop Distribution and Pumping:**

Distribution piping and receiver shell heat gains are optional elements in load calculation, typically small compared to other loads. Pump ratings are provided for full-load design conditions, and pumping power is calculated based on flow rate and pressure drop. Multiple pumps can be used to reduce total pumping power, providing capacity to meet peak loads.

**Transcritical CO2 Refrigeration Systems:**

This system models transcritical CO2 booster refrigeration systems, used in supermarkets, allowing for modeling single or two-stage systems with medium- and low-temperature loads. The system includes components like compressors and air-cooled gas coolers. Transcritical cycles involve a subcritical evaporation process and a supercritical gas cooling process, where CO2 changes from a liquid-vapor mixture to superheated vapor, absorbing heat for cooling. The system uses a gas cooler to reduce the CO2 temperature after compression, rather than a condenser.

**CO2 Compressor Performance Modeling:**

Compressor performance during subcritical and transcritical operation is modeled using cubic polynomials to fit manufacturers' data. Power consumption and cooling capacity are functions of temperatures and pressures. Correlation coefficients are obtained from manufacturers or curve fits of performance data. Adjustments for subcooling and superheat conditions are necessary to reflect actual conditions.

**Gas Cooler Performance:**

Transcritical refrigeration systems typically have one gas cooler, but multiple refrigeration systems can share a gas cooler for heat rejection.

This structured text provides a coherent overview of the modeling and operational aspects of Trombe Walls and Water Thermal Tanks within the EnergyPlus environment, focusing on their input files, results, and control algorithms.**Design Flow Rate and Water Heater Positioning:**

The water heater is installed on the supply side of a plant loop. Once the plant sizing routines are completed, the design flow rate for all components on the demand side is obtained. The tank volume is calculated using the design flow rate and a specified draw time.

**Residential HUD-FHA Minimum:**

The tank volume is determined according to rules from the 1999 ASHRAE Handbook, HVAC Applications. These guidelines specify minimum storage and burner capacities based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a residence. For example, the guidelines specify different storage requirements for gas and electric storage, as well as corresponding burner capacities.

Heat gain from water use equipment is calculated based on initial water and zone conditions, with sensible and latent heat gains computed separately. Connected water use equipment is managed by a WaterUse:Connections object, allowing for multiple equipment pieces with a common supply and return.

This structured information provides a comprehensive overview of the design, sizing, and operation of water heating and use systems, ensuring optimal performance and compliance with industry standards.The text describes the functionality and application of zone control systems in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, specifically focusing on humidity and thermal comfort management. It outlines the methods used to manage relative humidity and thermal comfort within a zone, including the use of humidistats and thermostats.

### Zone Humidity Control
1. **Humidity Control Mechanism**: The `ZoneControl:Humidistat` object is used to manage relative humidity within a zone. This can be set to a single or dual humidity schedule, allowing for precise control over humidifying and dehumidifying processes.

2. **Single and Dual Setpoint Humidistats**: A single setpoint humidistat adjusts equipment to meet a specific humidity level. In contrast, a dual setpoint humidistat manages both humidification and dehumidification processes, ensuring the zone remains within a desired humidity range.

3. **Integration with HVAC Systems**: When linked with HVAC systems, the humidistat can directly control components like furnaces or unitary systems. For more advanced control, managers such as `SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Minimum` and `SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum` are utilized to maintain desired humidity levels.

4. **Humidity Load Calculations**: The system calculates moisture loads required to achieve setpoints using various predictive algorithms, determining the necessary moisture addition or removal.

### Thermal Comfort Control
1. **Thermal Comfort Management**: The `ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort` object manages temperature based on thermal comfort models such as the Fanger model. This ensures the zone maintains conditions conducive to occupant comfort.

2. **Control Types**: Different control types (e.g., single heating, single cooling, dual setpoint) allow for tailored thermal management strategies. These types are defined within schedules that dictate how the system responds to varying conditions.

3. **Setpoint Calculations**: For each control type, setpoint temperatures are calculated based on selected comfort models, adapting throughout the simulation to maintain desired thermal conditions.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptation**: The system provides flexible control options, allowing users to define thermal comfort settings for specific time periods, ensuring optimal comfort throughout different scenarios.

### Air Distribution and Equipment
1. **Air Distribution Units**: The `ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit` connects centrally conditioned air with a zone, facilitating the distribution of air through various terminal units. This component plays a crucial role in the overall HVAC system's efficiency and effectiveness.

2. **Mixer Functionality**: The `AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer` blends centrally conditioned air with zone-specific air streams, optimizing the air delivery based on current requirements and ensuring efficient operation.

3. **Duct Leakage Model**: The Simple Duct Leakage Model (SDLM) provides a streamlined approach to evaluating energy losses due to duct leakage. It simplifies the simulation by avoiding complex airflow network models, instead using mass and energy balance calculations to assess leakage impacts.

Overall, the text highlights the complex interactions within HVAC systems, emphasizing the importance of precise control over humidity and temperature to ensure comfort and efficiency. The integration of advanced control objects and predictive algorithms allows for adaptive management of environmental conditions within a zone.The VAV system is controlled to a constant static pressure setpoint. In EnergyPlus, SDLM is not applicable to systems using static pressure reset. SDLM requires knowledge of static pressure as a function of system air flow rate.

Inputs and Data for SDLM are entered through the ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit (ADU) object, consisting of two data items per ADU: the upstream nominal leakage fraction and the downstream fixed leakage fraction. These are leakage fractions. Input (1) is the leakage fraction at design flow rate, used to determine the constant leakage flow rate upstream of the VAV boxes. Input (2) is a constant fixed leakage fraction as the flow rate varies.

Implementation involves various zone mass flow rates related in a specific manner:
- \( \dot{m}_{s,us} = \dot{m}_{tu} + \dot{m}_{lk,us} \)
- \( \dot{m}_{tu} = \dot{m}_{lk,ds} + \dot{m}_{s,z} \)
- \( \dot{m}_{lk,us} = Frac_{us} \cdot \dot{m}_{s,us,max} \)
- \( \dot{m}_{lk,ds} = Frac_{ds} \cdot \dot{m}_{tu} \)

where:
- \( \dot{m}_{s,us} \) is the constant zone supply air mass flow rate upstream of the leaks (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{tu} \) is the air mass flow rate through the terminal unit (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{lk,us} \) is the upstream leakage air mass flow rate (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{lk,ds} \) is the downstream leakage air mass flow rate (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{s,us,max} \) is the maximum upstream supply air mass flow rate (program input) (kg/s)
- \( \dot{m}_{s,z} \) is the supply air mass flow rate delivered to the zone (kg/s)
- \( Frac_{us} \) is the design upstream leakage fraction (program input)
- \( Frac_{ds} \) is the constant downstream leakage fraction (program input)

The VAV terminal unit model calculates \( \dot{m}_{tu} \) by varying the mass flow rate to meet the zone load. Upstream leakage is accounted for by resetting the maximum air mass flow rate available to: \( \dot{m}'_{MaxAvail} = \dot{m}_{MaxAvail} - \dot{m}_{lk,us} \).

The load met is calculated as \( \dot{Q}_{z,adjusted} = \frac{1}{1 - Frac_{ds}} \dot{Q}_{z} \) where \( \dot{Q}_{z} \) is the actual zone load (met by \( \dot{m}_{s,z} \)).

The implementation ensures air mass flow is not conserved through the unit: the two air leakage flow rates disappear but are stored in the air distribution unit data structure. The downstream return air plenum mass and energy balances are calculated by adding back the leakage flow rate data as inlets to the return air plenum, preserving mass balance.

Fan Coil Unit Overview:
The input object ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil provides a model for a 4 pipe fan coil zonal hydronic unit supplying heating and cooling to a zone. It has a hot water or electric heating coil, a chilled water coil, and a fan. The fan runs at constant speed, controlled by throttling the hot or cold water flow.

The 4 pipe fan coil unit consists of four sub-components: an outdoor air mixer, a fan, a cooling coil, and a heating coil. In EnergyPlus, these are represented by:
1. OutdoorAir:Mixer
2. Fan:ConstantVolume
3. Coil:Cooling:Water, Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry, or CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted
4. Coil:Heating:Water or Coil:Heating:Electric

The unit is a forward model: inputs are the state of its inlets (recirculated and outdoor air), and outputs are the conditions of the outlet air stream (flow rate, temperature, and humidity ratio).

The user describes the fan coil unit by inputting the names of the outdoor air mixer, fan, heating coil, and cooling coil, along with node names for the unit's air inlet (recirculated air node), air outlet node, outdoor air node, relief node, inlet hot water node, and inlet chilled water node. Maximum flow rates for supply air, outdoor air inlet, chilled water, and hot water must be specified, along with heating and cooling convergence tolerances and an on/off availability schedule.

Calculation:
Given inputs, the output temperature, humidity ratio, and flow rate of the recirculated and outdoor air streams are determined by simulating the outdoor air mixer, fan, cooling coil, and heating coil. The unit's load met (sensible cooling or heating) is calculated.

Simulation and Control:
The current heating/cooling demand on the unit is determined from zone simulation results. If the load is less than 1 watt or flow rate less than .001 kg/s, the unit is off. When off, there will be no airflow through the unit, and outlet conditions equal inlet conditions.

The total cooling/heating output is calculated: 
\( \dot{Q}_{tot,out} = \dot{m} \cdot (PsyHFnTdbW (T_{out},W_{out}) - PsyHFnTdbW (T_{in},W_{in})) \)

Multi-Speed Fan in FanCoil:
When modeling a multi-speed fan, capacity is modulated using speed ratio or part load ratio. The supply air fan speed is varied while operating coils at maximum water flow. The speed ratio and part-load ratio are calculated to satisfy the required system zone cooling or heating load.

ASHRAE 90.1:
The ASHRAE 90.1 control method adjusts fan speed based on zone design sensible load, requiring a simulation sizing run to determine the zone design sensible load. The fan and coils modulate to meet the zone load, maintaining reduced speed while modulating water coils to meet the zone load.

Window Air Conditioner Overview:
The input object ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner models a packaged unit supplying cooling to a zone. It includes a fan, a DX cooling coil, and an outdoor air inlet. The coil cycles on/off to meet the cooling load. The fan can operate continuously or cycle on/off with the coil.

The unit consists of three sub-components: an outdoor air mixer, a fan, and a DX coil. Inputs define the state of its inlets (recirculated and outdoor air), and outputs are the conditions of the outlet air stream.

The user specifies unit connectivity, flow rate, and an availability schedule. The unit's design cooling capacity is specified in the DX coil object.

Calculation:
Given inputs, the output is determined by simulating the outdoor air mixer, fan, and coil. The part load ratio is iteratively adjusted to satisfy the cooling load.

Simulation and Control:
Based on the zone simulation results, the unit's heating/cooling demand is determined, and the unit is turned on/off accordingly. The part load fraction is iteratively adjusted to achieve the desired cooling output.The text provides a detailed explanation of the operation and simulation of a Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner (PTAC) within the EnergyPlus software. The PTAC model is a compound object consisting of various components such as an outdoor air mixer, a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, a heating coil, and a supply air fan. The PTAC is designed to condition a single zone, controlled by a thermostat, and operates to meet the zone's sensible cooling or heating requirements.

### Overview
The PTAC coordinates its components' operations and functions as a type of zone equipment. It can model both draw-through and blow-through fan placements. The PTAC operates based on the thermostat schedule, calculating the required part-load ratio for its coils and fan to meet the zone's demands. It can operate in two fan modes: cycling fan (AUTO fan) or continuous fan (fan ON), controlled by a supply air fan operating mode schedule.

### Model Description
Each simulation time step involves EnergyPlus performing a zone air heat balance to determine cooling or heating needs, excluding PTAC impacts. The PTAC adjusts its performance accordingly, either cycling its coils or maintaining continuous fan operation, based on the user-defined settings. The model calculates the average airflow rate and part-load ratio for cooling and heating operations.

### Cooling Operation
When cooling is needed, the PTAC calculates the sensible cooling rate under full-load and coil-off conditions. The cooling rate depends on the supply air fan, outdoor air mixer, and DX cooling coil. The compressor part-load ratio is determined iteratively to match the cooling output to the zone load. The supply air conditions vary based on whether the fan is cycling or continuous.

### Heating Operation
The PTAC calculates the sensible heating rate similarly to cooling. Iterative calculations determine the final heating part-load ratio, accounting for non-linear performance and fan heat variations. If full-load heating is insufficient, the part-load ratio is set to ensure maximum possible heating.

### Single Zone VAV Control
The PTAC can simulate single zone variable-air-volume (VAV) control, maintaining low fan speed through a range of loads. This control scheme modulates the coil to meet user-specified outlet air temperature limits, increasing fan speed as needed. It is active only for constant fan operation and allows specific coil types.

### Average Air Flow Calculations
The PTAC operates based on user-specified air flow rates, which can vary between cooling, heating, and fan-only modes. The model calculates average supply and outdoor air mass flow rates considering the part-load ratio of the coils.

### Calculation of Outlet Air Conditions
Outlet air conditions are reported based on whether the supply air fan cycles with the coils or runs continuously. These conditions reflect the average operation over the simulation time step.

### Calculation of Zone Heating and Cooling Rates
At each HVAC simulation time step's end, the PTAC reports the heating or cooling rates and energy delivered to the zone. The total, sensible, and latent energy transfer rates are calculated, and only positive values are reported for cooling and heating.

**Battery Cycle and Life Prediction**

State of charge (SOC) management involves discharging the battery to a lower SOC and then recharging it back to the original SOC. The cycle's magnitude is more critical than the average SOC during the cycle. A cycle from 90% to 70% and back to 90% SOC is equivalent in impact to a cycle from 50% to 30% and back to 50% SOC. Battery life, in terms of the number of cycles, is predicted based on the cycle range using a double exponential equation for damage estimation. The equation is CF = C1 + C2e^C3R + C4e^C5R, where CF is cycles to failure, C1-C5 are regression coefficients, and R is the cycle range in fractional SOC terms. The rainflow counting method is used to count battery cycles, and damage is estimated as D = Σ(N_i / CF_i), where D is fractional battery damage, CF_i is cycles to failure for the i-th cycle range, and N_i is total cycles in the i-th range. Temperature effects are not supported in the current model.

**Lithium-Ion NMC Model**

The Lithium-Ion NMC Model includes a performance and capacity degradation model. The performance model captures voltage, charging, discharging power, and battery temperature dynamics, while the capacity degradation model estimates capacity loss over time and use. The SAM model balances complexity for real-time control, expressing battery terminal voltage as V = Vo - I·Rint - K(qmax / (qmax - R I·dt)) + a·e^(-B·I·dt). The thermal model considers battery temperature impacts on capacity and degradation rate. The capacity model updates charge based on current, affecting energy and power calculations. Capacity degradation considers SEI formation and electrode damage, with equations modeling degradation over time and cycles.

**Transformers in Electric Distribution**

Transformers step down voltage from utility to customer levels and manage surplus power from generators to the grid. They have two main loss types: no load loss (core loss) and load loss (winding loss). Total energy losses at time t are TL(t) = NL + LL(t) = NL + LL·P(t)^2·fT(t), where P(t) is per unit load, and fT(t) is temperature correction for load loss. Transformer efficiency is η(t) = Load(t) / (Load(t) + NL + LL(t)). When nominal efficiency is given, no load loss and load loss can be derived from efficiency data.

**Photovoltaic Arrays**

Photovoltaic arrays convert solar energy to electricity, with models including "Simple," "Equivalent One-Diode," and "Sandia." The Simple Model predicts energy production using surface conversion efficiency, solar radiation, and user inputs. The usable electrical power is P = Asurf·factiv·GT·ηcell·ηinvert, where GT is total solar radiation incident on the array, and other parameters are user-defined. PV arrays are managed by an electric load center, and power levels are assumed constant over the timestep for energy production calculations.

This structured text provides an overview of state water consumption factors for electricity generation and a detailed explanation of component load estimation in building energy simulation programs.Heat emissions from buildings significantly impact climate change and urban microclimates, such as the urban heat island effect. These emissions come from three levels of building systems: the building envelope, zones/spaces, and HVAC systems. Understanding the magnitude and distribution of these emissions is crucial for urban climate studies and mitigating their effects. Heat emissions are calculated by considering heat releases from building envelopes, zones, and HVAC systems. Emissions have both positive and negative values, indicating whether the building injects or extracts heat from the environment.

### Heat Emission from Building Envelope

The Heat Index combines air temperature and relative humidity to estimate apparent temperature. It categorizes health risks into levels like Safe, Caution, and Extreme Danger, guiding measures against heat stress.

#### Humidex
Used in Canada, the Humidex measures discomfort by combining heat and humidity effects. It categorizes levels of discomfort and potential health risks, aiding in public safety during hot conditions.

#### Standard Effective Temperature (SET)
SET models human thermal response, considering clothing and metabolic rate. It is used for assessing thermal comfort and safety, particularly in scenarios like power outages. Metrics like SET-degree-days help evaluate building thermal performance.

**Hours of Safety**

Hours of Safety is a framework developed by EPA and RMI to understand how long a home can maintain safe indoor temperature levels during a power outage, based on building characteristics and energy efficiency levels like insulation and infiltration. This metric helps to quantify exposure to extreme indoor temperatures and guide weatherization and emergency response efforts. Hours of Safety for cold or hot events should be defined from the start of the risk period to not exceed temperature thresholds for specific populations. Thresholds are controlled using EnergyPlus's thermal comfort model, with default cold stress thresholds set at 60°F (16°C) for the healthy, 64°F (18°C) for the elderly, and 71°F (22°C) for nursing home residents, while the hot stress threshold is 86°F (30°C).

**Setpoint Unmet Degree-Hours (UDH)**

UDH is a metric that weights each hour a conditioned zone's temperature exceeds a threshold by the degrees it surpasses that threshold, offering a more complete picture of temperature exceedance history compared to average temperature or unmet hours.

**Discomfort-weighted Exceedance**

This metric sums positive values of predicted mean vote (PMV) exceedance during occupied hours for warm, cool, very-hot, and very-cold conditions. Tools like CBE's online tool can compute related thermal comfort metrics.

**Indoor Air Quality - CO2 Resilience**

Indoor CO2 concentration is used as an indicator of air quality, with levels above 5,000 ppm posing health risks. Maintaining indoor CO2 levels no greater than 700 ppm above outdoor levels ensures visitor satisfaction. EnergyPlus calculates and reports Zone Air CO2 Concentration, and users can define outdoor air CO2 schedules for simulations.

**Visual Resilience**

Adequate indoor lighting is crucial for safety and productivity. Different spaces require varying illuminance levels, ranging from 100 lux for corridors to over 500 lux for detailed work areas. EnergyPlus can simulate indoor illuminance levels for resilience reporting.

**Timespan of Report**

Resilience metrics are evaluated during specific risk periods, such as power outages or heatwaves, which can be defined using the Output:Table:ReportPeriod input object.
