# Fine-tuning Data Curation for LLM-based Question-Answering Using LoRA/QLoRA for a Specific Domain

This repo contains the INFO 621 final project of Our (Pineapple Programmers) team, which includes three team members: Xiaoqin Fu, Subhrajeet Ghosh, and Usama Ahmed. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning data curation method for answering questions of a specific domain: building energy sector.

The building sector accounts for one-third of U.S. carbon emissions, making decarbonization a critical priority. Effective data management is essential for this effort, as vast amounts of building-related information—such as codes, standards, and operational data—must be analyzed to inform decision-making. Recent advancements in AI and large language models (LLMs) have the ability to process, interpret, and generate text, making them effective for accessing relevant insights. However, foundational LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, T5, BERT) rely on general datasets that lack the specialized knowledge required for building decarbonization. Fine-tuning these models with domain-specific data presents a promising solution, though challenges remain in addressing missing, duplicate, inconsistent, or unstructured information.
